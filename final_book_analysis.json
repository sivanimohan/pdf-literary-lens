      "short_summary": "This chapter introduces the book's authors: Dr. John Vervaeke, Christopher Mastropietro, and Filip Miscevic, who are academics with backgrounds in cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. Their work converges on addressing the \"Meaning Crisis\" in Western culture, for which they consider the zombie a key cultural symbol.",
      "long_summary": "Of course. Here is a detailed summary of the provided \"Authors\" chapter from the book *Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis*.\n\n### Summary of the \"Authors\" Chapter\n\nThis text introduces the three authors of the book, establishing their academic credentials, research interests, and, most importantly, their shared intellectual project. The central theme connecting all three authors is their focus on what they term the **\"Meaning Crisis\" in Western culture**, for which the figure of the zombie serves as a central symbol. The author biographies collectively signal a multi-disciplinary approach to this topic, blending cognitive science, philosophy, neuroscience, and semiotics.\n\n#### **Dr. John Vervaeke**\nDr. John Vervaeke is presented as the senior academic and mentor of the group.\n\n*   **Position and Affiliation:** He is an Assistant Professor in the teaching stream at the University of Toronto, where he has taught since 1994 in the Psychology Department and the Cognitive Science Program.\n*   **Accolades:** He is a recognized and award-winning teacher, highlighting his commitment to education.\n*   **Academic Interests:** His published work covers topics central to understanding human cognition and consciousness, such as **relevance realization, general intelligence, mindfulness, metaphor, and wisdom.**\n*   **Core Motivation:** His biography explicitly states that his \"abiding passion\" is to address the **Meaning Crisis** that he believes is a significant problem in Western society. This positions him as the intellectual anchor for the book's primary thesis.\n\n#### **Christopher Mastropietro**\nChristopher Mastropietro is positioned as a long-term collaborator who brings a humanities and philosophical perspective to the project.\n\n*   **Position and Affiliation:** He has been working with John Vervaeke since 2012. His academic background is a BA from the University of Toronto in **semiotics, philosophy, and political science.**\n*   **Role in the Project:** His work with Vervaeke is aimed at formulating and publishing a direct response to the Meaning Crisis. This response is framed as a convergence of insights from cognitive science, philosophy, and other disciplines.\n*   **Academic Interests:** His specific interests lie in the **interaction between sacred symbols and wisdom**, and how identity emerges through interpersonal relationships. This suggests he will contribute analysis on the cultural, symbolic, and existential dimensions of the crisis.\n\n#### **Filip Miscevic**\nFilip Miscevic represents the next generation of scholars, bringing a cutting-edge, computational, and neuroscientific lens to the topic.\n\n*   **Position and Affiliation:** He is a Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana University Bloomington, studying **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**.\n*   **Connection to Vervaeke:** He was a student of John Vervaeke at the University of Toronto, where he completed a BSc in cognitive science, neuroscience, and computer science. This establishes a direct line of intellectual inheritance and collaboration.\n*   **Academic Interests and Motivation:** He is interested in how a scientific understanding of the mind can revolutionize not only clinical practices but also social and cultural ones. He directly connects this to the book's theme, stating his interest in how this understanding will \"bear on the Meaning Crisis.\"\n*   **The Zombie as a Central Metaphor:** His biography provides the most explicit link between the book's title and its theme, stating that the **zombie has become the \"flag-bearer\"** for the Meaning Crisis. This key phrase crystallizes the book's central premise.\n\n### Synthesis and Overall Impression\n\nThe author page functions as a mission statement for the book. It establishes that *Zombies in Western Culture* is not merely a work of pop culture analysis but a serious academic inquiry into a profound societal issue—the \"Meaning Crisis.\" The authors' backgrounds indicate a powerful, interdisciplinary approach:\n\n1.  **Vervaeke** provides the foundational framework from cognitive science and psychology, with a deep focus on wisdom and meaning.\n2.  **Mastropietro** adds depth from philosophy, semiotics, and symbolic analysis, likely exploring the cultural and historical roots of the crisis.\n3.  **Miscevic** brings a modern, empirical perspective from neuroscience and computational modeling, aiming to ground the discussion in the mechanics of the mind.\n\nIn essence, this chapter informs the reader that the book will use the cultural phenomenon of the zombie as a diagnostic tool to explore a deep-seated crisis of meaning, drawing on a rich and convergent blend of scientific and humanistic disciplines.",

      "short_summary": "This chapter argues that the zombie has exploded from a niche horror trope into a dominant 21st-century cultural zeitgeist, evident in films, television, and public events. The authors propose that this phenomenon symbolizes a profound crisis of meaning in Western culture, where the zombie represents humanity's loss of purpose following the collapse of traditional worldviews.",
      "long_summary": "Of course. Here is a detailed summary of the chapter \"1. A New Zeitgeist\" from *Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis*.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Summary of \"A New Zeitgeist\"**\n\nThis introductory chapter establishes the central thesis of the book: the explosion of zombies in 21st-century Western popular culture is not a mere trend but a **zeitgeist**—the spirit of the age—that serves as a powerful and complex symbol for a profound **crisis of meaning** in modern society.\n\n#### **The Rise of the Zombie Phenomenon**\n\nThe chapter begins by highlighting the real-world manifestation of zombie culture through the emergence of **\"zombie walks\"** starting in 2001. These public performance art events, which grew from dozens of participants to over 9,000 in Mexico City by 2011, illustrate how the zombie concept has moved from fiction into a participatory cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe authors contrast this modern phenomenon with the origin of the cinematic zombie in the 1932 film *White Zombie*. In this early depiction, the zombie was a magically-created, soulless but beautiful shell, as captured by the quote, \"the soul is gone. I can’t bear those empty, staring eyes.\" This historical anchor shows how the zombie has evolved from a specific voodoo creation into a much broader and more grotesque symbol.\n\nThe chapter provides compelling evidence for the zombie's cultural explosion in the 21st century:\n*   **Statistical Data:** A Google N-Gram graph shows a dramatic spike in the use of the word \"zombie\" after the year 2000.\n*   **Film Production:** Over half of the 600+ zombie movies made since 1920 were produced in the decade prior to the book's publication (c. 2007-2017), with notable waves around 2001 and 2008.\n*   **Media Saturation:** The zombie has dominated various media, including blockbuster films (*28 Days Later*, *World War Z*), hit TV series (*The Walking Dead*), and acclaimed video games (*The Last of Us*).\n*   **Genre-Bending:** The zombie has transcended its horror origins, appearing in comedies (*Shaun of the Dead*) and romances (*Warm Bodies*), proving its versatility and status as a \"pervasive cultural symbol.\"\n\n#### **The Central Thesis: A Crisis of Meaning**\n\nThe authors argue that while many academics have interpreted the zombie as a metaphor for specific modern anxieties—such as consumerism, disease, or environmental collapse—these interpretations are \"plausible without being sufficient.\" They contend that viewing the zombie as a symbol for any single issue is a \"forest for the trees\" error.\n\nInstead, the authors propose a more comprehensive theory: all these interpretations are merely **symptoms of a much deeper and broader problem**. Their central argument is that the zombie zeitgeist is a **\"constellation of four intersecting symbols\"** that represents an unprecedented **\"crisis of worldview\"** in Western civilization. This crisis affects life on personal, social, political, and religious levels, undermining humanity's unique ability to create and sustain meaning.\n\nA crucial secondary argument is that the zombie symbol derives its power from being a **perversion of the Christian mythos of death and resurrection**. The zombie is an anti-resurrection; it returns from death not as a saved soul but as a mindless, decaying body. In this way, the zombie represents the loss of the **\"sacred canopy\"** once provided by Christianity—a coherent worldview that explained life, death, and one's place in the cosmos. The zombie's features have evolved along the \"fault lines of this loss.\"\n\n#### **Roadmap for the Book**\n\nThe chapter concludes by laying out the structure for the rest of the book, outlining how the authors will develop their argument:\n\n*   **Section 2:** Will trace the **genealogy** of the zombie, explaining how it replaced aliens as the preeminent monster for a post-Cold War world.\n*   **Section 3:** Will provide the main analysis, breaking the zombie myth down into **four predominant symbols** found in its attributes, narrative, and apocalyptic ecology.\n*   **Section 4:** Will introduce the concept of **\"cultural domicide\"** (the destruction of home or one's worldview) using historical case studies to build a framework for understanding the meaning crisis.\n*   **Section 5:** Will detail the **symptomatology of the crisis** using the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as an analogue for the personal, social, political, and religious domains affected.\n*   **Section 6:** Will offer a brief history of the crisis, tracing it back to the decline of the Aristotelian and Christian paradigms that once structured the Western worldview.\n\n#### **Two Fundamental Claims**\n\nFinally, the chapter reiterates two foundational claims that will guide the book's analysis:\n\n1.  **\"Zombies are us.\"** More specifically, they represent the decay of what is most meaningful within us—our ability to make sense of our lives and our world. The Huxley epigraph, \"Not the Black Death, this time; the Gray Life,\" perfectly captures this idea of a spiritual, internal plague of meaninglessness.\n2.  **The zombie zeitgeist is an inarticulate expression.** It is \"raw pop art\" that powerfully expresses the existence of the meaning crisis but does not analyze or explain it. The authors' goal is to provide the critical evaluation needed to understand the gravity of what the zombie symbol represents.",

It occurs first in Sacramento, California and again two years \nlater in Toronto, Ontario. By 2008, it starts recurring annually in certain \nurban centers, grows steadily with each passing year, and spreads \nfrom one city to the next. Sometimes it has fewer than 50 participants. \nSometimes it has over 1000. In late 2011, Mexico City boasts a record \nof 9,000. Some gatherings are meticulous and coordinated, others are \nimpromptu. Some participants join in advance, and many decide to \nfollow spontaneously. Before long, the phenomenon begins to spread \naround the globe.\nFig. 3: “I thought that beauty alone would satisfy. But the soul is gone. \nI can’t bear those empty, staring eyes”. Screenshot from the Halperin \nbrothers ’ 1932 film, White Zombie , at 40:11.3\nIt should surprise us that these “walks” have only begun to appear, \nwhen the paradigm for their behavior has existed since the Halperin \nbrothers  produced White Zombie  in 1932. In this film, a young man \nturned voodoo master transforms a young woman into a subordinate, \npale-skinned corpse. Though his motive is initially to gain her love, his \nmagic succeeds only in removing her vitality. This ironic consequence \ncomes to effect change in his intentions, and he repents to her: “I thought \nthat beauty alone would satisfy. But the soul is gone. I can’t bear those \nempty, staring eyes”. It is a mark of how the zombie has developed over \nthe years that the word “beauty” could ever have been used to describe it.\n3                                  A remastered version of the movie is available at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=lQ0hL4EBC58\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

A New Zeitgeist\nThe outbreak of zombieism is a twentieth century phenomenon, but \nin the twenty-first century it explodes into zeitgeist. Over 600 zombie \nmovies have been made since 1920, but over one half of them have been \nin the last 10 years. Two great waves have lapped onto the shore of \nAmerican cinema since 2000: one around 2001, and then again in 2008.4 \nTwenty-Eight Days Later  comes out in 2002, George Romero ’s Dawn of the \nDead  is remade in 2004, and Zombieland  becomes the highest-grossing \nzombie film to date in 2009. This is quickly overtaken in 2013, first by \nWarm Bodies , and then by the Brad Pitt epic, World War Z .5 By 2015, there \nare three TV series based on zombies: Z Nation  on Netflix, iZombie  on \nCW, and AMC’s breakthrough hit, The Walking Dead .6 The genre has \nalso enjoyed considerable success in the medium of video games, most \nnotably in the highly lauded The Last of Us .7\nClearly, the zombie has transcended the constraints of its own genre. \nWhereas early zombie films closely adhered to horror tropes, more recent \nrenditions have wed themselves to comedy and romance (Zack Snyder  \nreleased the comedic Shaun of the Dead  in 2004 to critical and popular \nacclaim),8 and broken away from melodrama. The zombie has become a \npervasive cultural symbol  that is constantly expanding its reference, not \ncontent to relegate itself to its tradition. As Dele uze and G uattari (1972: \n332) put it “the only modern myth is the myth of zombies”. The zombie \nseems to be a shifting signifier with an unending hermeneutical compass. \nAnd yet its features remain remarkably consistent from one story to the \nnext, and it has represented many varieties of apocalypse  without altering \nits basic nature: consumerism, poverty, hunger, political dystopia and \n4                                                Annalee Newitz (2008), “War and Social Upheaval Cause Spikes in Zombie Movie \nProduction”, i09.com\n5                                Trailers available on YouTube: Twenty-Eight Days Later  at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=c7ynwAgQlDQ ; Dawn of the Dead  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\n-IIwV_Y6VU ; Zombieland  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m9EVP8X7N8 ; \nWarm Bodies  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvjwKqA2_9U ; World War Z  \nat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwTxRuq-uk\n6                Trailers are available on YouTube: Z Nation  at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=7ZFIS2AqAz8 ; iZombie  (Season 1) at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=UndyIFo_jZ4 ; The Walking Dead  (Season 1) at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=sfAc2U20uyg\n7                The trailer of The Last of Us  is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=OQWD5W3fpPM\n8                The trailer of Shaun of the Dead  is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.\ncom/watch?v=LIfcaZ4pC-4\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

No longer simply a vehicle for entertainment, it has become \nthe basis for critical reflection and cultural self-examination, to which an \nincreasing number of academic publications on t he subject atte st (Goto-\nJones  2015; Moreman 2010; We bb and Byrnand 2008). For instance, \nTelevision Ontario devoted an episode of The Agenda with Steve Paikin  \nin 2011 to an unreserved examination of humanity’s most nauseating \nadversary. Four panelists―Daniel Drezner , Arnold T. Blumberg , Robert \nSmith  and Andrew Watson ―sat down to parse its menaces and flesh out \nits metaphors. Zombies have pressed us with the dangers of a unique \nmoment in time, and they have become the most enduring, expressive \nand consummate metaphor for our crisis in meaning.\nThe zombie has been subject to a vast variety of interpretations by \nculture theorists and academics. To examine these exhaustively would \nbe beyond the scope of this or any other monograph. The affinity \nbetween zombies and states of human decrepitude has permitted the \nview that zombies can stand for nearly every conceivable human failing. \nThe present authors propose that the interpretations most favoured by \nacademics―mortality, consumerism and environmental degradation \namong them―are plausible without being sufficient. The mere fact that \neach seems to apply invalidates the proposition that any one of them can \napply exclusively. We take the position that this exegetic pigeonholing \noften falls deftly into the “forest for the trees” category of thinking. The \nzombie zeitgeist accommodates interpretations of disquiet about many \ntopics, yet we will argue that each of these readings should be understood \nas elements of a broader symptomatology. This symptomatology, we \nwill explain, relates to a condition that is far more complex than has \nbeen supposed by any theorist that has previously written on this topic.\nWe propose that the cultural phenomenon of the zombie has provided \nus with a constellation of four intersecting symbols for a modern \nhuman ethos, and that these symbols represent a crisis of worldview  \nthat has no precedent in modern western civilization. Our use of the \ncollective pronoun “we” shall be in broad reference to North-American \nand Western culture more generally. This limitation notwithstanding, \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 5\n1. A New Zeitgeist\nthe authors will make no claims regarding the applicability of these \narguments to cultures that may fall outside of that moniker.9\nIn this book we will suggest that the appearance of these zombie \nsymbols is approximately co-emergent with the West’s dawning \ncultural awareness of a worldview  crisis, and that there are sufficient \ncorrelations between the traits of the zombie and the symptomology \nof the crisis to demonstrate this linkage reliably. We will provide a \npreliminary discussion of the origins of the crisis (the full argument \nwill be reserved for forthcoming work), and argue that it is extant in \nthe personal, social, political and religious domains of life in which we \nparticipate, and which define us uniquely as a meaning-making species.\nIn the forthcoming sections, we will also argue that while the zombie is \na versatile enough symbol  to stand for many kinds of human defilement, \nthe symbol ultimately draws its aptness from being a perversion of the \nChristian  mythos of death and resurrection , and that most of its traits \nand features have emerged from, and harken back to, the matrix of the \nChristian worldview . We will contend that the zombie has evolved to \nbecome a representation of the loss of the sacred canopy  traditionally \nprovided by Christianity , and that its features have evolved along the \nfault lines of this loss, representing a world that no longer explains itself, \nnor provides us instruction for how to live within it.\nSection 2  will retrace the genealogy  of the zombie from its precursory \ninfluences and the peak popularity that began at the turn of this century. \nWe will also discuss how the zombie replaced the extra-terrestrials to \nbecome the preeminent monster for the twenty-first century, reflecting \nthe weariness and alienation left by the Cold War  and the threa t of \nnuclear apocalypse .\nSection 3  will provide the main exegesis of the zombie itself, \nseparating its myth into four predominant symbols that are recurrent \nin its popular depictions in film, television, and other literature. These \nsymbols will not simply be icons associated with the zombie’s image; \n9                It will be apparent throughout the monograph that our reference to ‘the West’ \nis invoked with predominantly American examples. As the US is the most \nsignificant exporter of popular culture in the West, our focus on American culture \nis proportionate to its contribution to the phenomenon. Though this does \nnot necessarily suggest that the phenomenon is absent from other western \ncountries, America certainly seems to be the epicenter of the crisis, and most \nexemplary of its features.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

All rights reserved. \n6 \nZombies in Western Culture\nthey will be the zombie’s physical attributes, the treatment of its name, \ncontortions of its narrative structure and the ecology of apocalypse  that \ninvariably follows it f rom one story to the next.\nSection 4  will introduce the concept of cultural domicide  (the \ndestruction of home) by exploring two chronologically distant but \nrevealing case studies examining the loss of home on a cultural scale. \nThe first of these will refer the Grassy Narrows  First Nation in Ontario, \nCanada, and the second to the decline of the Hellenistic  civilization \nfollowing the death of Alexander the Great  in 323 BCE. This section \nwill depart from discussions of the zombie to build a framework for \nworldview attunement  that will inform the discuss ions in the remaining \nsections.\nSection 5  will discuss the symptomatology of this crisis in detail \nusing the four horsemen of the Christian  apocalypse  as an analogue \nfor the four domains affected by the meaning crisis. Famine , Pestilence , \nWar and Death will stand for the personal, social, political and religious \nmanifestations of the crisis, framed by the loss of worldview  introduced \nin the previous section.\nSection 6  will offer an overview of the historical origins of the \nmeaning crisis, tracing the rise and fall of a western worldview  that \nwas composed of three constellating orders from the Aristotelean \nand Christian  paradigms. This introductory genealogy  will chronicle \nthe emergence of our cultural domicide  throughout the centuries, an \nargument that will be elaborated in forthcoming work.\nThough we will subdivide the representational corpus of the zombie \nzeitgeist into different  symbols in section 3 , and the symptoms in section \n5, we will also refer to the amalgam of zombie phenomena as a single \nsymbol  for the purpose of surveying these phenomena collectively. \nThere are two fundamental claims that we will introduce hereto and \nreiterate throughout this book. The first is that, by almost all accounts, \nzombies are the fictionally distorted, self-reflected image of modern \nhumanity. Most zombie interpretations begin with this premise, that \nin some pivotal way, “zombies are us” (see e.g., Goto-Jones 2015, \nMoreman 2010, Webb and Byrnand 2008). This book will seek to add \nvalence and depth to this proposition. Zombies do represent us, but \nmore specifically, they represent the ruin of all that is meaningful  within \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 7\n1. A New Zeitgeist\nus. Zombies represent the modern deterioration of our uniquely human \nability to make and sustain meaning in our lives.\nThe second conclusion is that the zombie zeitgeist is a powerful but \ninarticulate form of representation. It is a raw opus of pop art, and it \nis not replete with self-analysis. The main function of zombie symbol  \nseems to express the meaning crisis, not to treat or explain it. Naturally \nthen, our aim here is to buffer the gaps within the zombie’s expression \nwith the evaluation required to appreciate its gravity. This is our \nundertaking in the forthcoming sections.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017.

This transition in monster \"zeitgeists\" is a direct result of the breakdown of shared cultural frameworks that once made society feel cohesive and understandable.\n\n**Part 1: The Decline of \"Cultural Canopies\"**\n\nThe chapter begins by establishing that in the past, Western societies operated under \"cultural canopies\"—shared frames of reference that made strangers feel less strange and social interactions more predictable. These canopies provided a \"universal commons\" that fostered a sense of familiarity and mutual understanding.\n\n*   **Christendom:** For centuries, Christendom served as a powerful canopy. It established a predictable range of behavior and a shared understanding of the sacred and the profane. This wasn't just about shared beliefs, but about creating an \"extended family\" metaphor that made others intelligible, even if they weren't always friendly.\n*   **Americanism:** In the 20th century, particularly after WWII, \"Americanism\" became another powerful cultural canopy. It represented a shared set of values, perspectives, and a \"faith in America\" that could unite two otherwise different Americans. It provided a common ground for connection.\n*   **The Current State:** The authors, citing Dreyfus and Kelly, argue that these canopies have disintegrated. We no longer share a uniform worldview. \"Americanism\" is now a hollow term, as two people can identify as American and share almost nothing in common. This has led to a pervasive sense of alienation and \"foreignness\" within our own communities, eroding social trust, common courtesy, and what the authors call **\"public intimacy\"**—the fundamental feeling of being understood by others.\n\n**Part 2: The Previous Monster Zeitgeist: The Alien**\n\nThe chapter explains that monsters in popular culture often embody the primary anxieties of their time. Before the zombie, the dominant monster metaphor for the social anxieties described above was the **extra-terrestrial alien**.\n\n*   **Origin and Context:** Popularized by H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds* and reaching its peak during the **Cold War**, the alien invasion narrative perfectly captured the era's paranoia.\n*   **What Aliens Represented:** The alien was a mask for the fear of outsiders, espionage, and infiltration. The narrative was that a cunning, external adversary was trying to secretly invade our society to dissolve our systems, propagate their own ideology, and turn us against each other.\n*   **Social Impact:** This metaphor reflected a world where you couldn't trust strangers, or even your neighbors. Anyone could be a secret enemy who was not who they appeared to be. The chapter cites the famous *Twilight Zone* episode \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\" as a perfect illustration, where disguised aliens cause paranoia and turn neighbors against one another, making them vulnerable to invasion by destroying their social cohesion from within.\n\n**Part 3: The Transition to the Zombie**\n\nThe chapter concludes by introducing the zombie as the new monster for a \"post-Cold War, post-globalized, post-Christian, and post-modern world.\" While zombies inherit some traits from the alien threat (like being an overwhelming force), they have significant differences that reflect our current anxieties more accurately.\n\nThe authors highlight two crucial distinctions between zombies and aliens:\n\n1.  **Zombies don't hide.** Unlike the cunning, disguised alien infiltrator, zombies are an overt and obvious threat. They do not bother with concealment or subterfuge.\n2.  **Zombies have no reason.** Unlike the imperialistic aliens who had a clear motive for their invasion (conquest, resources, ideology), zombies are mindless. They invade for no reason at all; they simply, unthinkingly, consume and spread.\n\nThis transition from a clever, motivated enemy (the alien) to a mindless, purposeless one (the zombie) marks a profound shift in what society fears most. The fear is no longer of a malicious, external \"other\" with a plan, but of something more internal, inexplicable, and devoid of meaning.",

But for stretches of our history, strangers \nhave not been as strange as they are now. There have been epochs of \nculture when we have sustained a concerted frame of reference that \nmade us known and knowable to one another wherever we lived. Even \nwhen we shared very little, we could be sure to find some universal \ncommons that would guarantee us familiarity with an unfamiliar person. \nFor much of our recent past, we in the West lived all under the canopy \nof Christendom. However varied or populated our society was, other \nhuman beings always offered a degree of predictability as long as they \nidentified  as Christians. We could always anticipate a median grade of \nbehavior, and presuppose binary limits on a spectrum between the sacred \nand the profane.1 Sustaining our religious commons was not as much \nabout celebrating common principles as much as it was about extending \nour scope of acquaintance. The “extended family” metaphors used in \nreligious discourse were very provident in fostering this acquaintance. \nStrangeness was never absolute strangeness, and we could find others \nintelligible to the degree that they assured a comprehensible―if not \nalways amiable―interaction.

They are not as comprehensively penetrating, \nand therefore less powerful than religious bonds. Thus, they are much \nmore susceptible to the vicissitudes of political and economic change. \nOne of the more puissant cultural canopies in the twentieth century \nwas the phenomenon of “ Americanism ”. Particularly in the latter half \nof the century, being American connoted a strong apotheosis of values \nand perspective for most Americans. In most cases, if two Americans \nhad diverging interests, backgrounds or orientations, they could be \nsure to touch base on certain convictions held mutually fundamental. \nSignificantly, many attribute the vitality of Americanness to the \ninfluence of a vernacular religiosity―the “faith in America”.\nYet, as Dreyfus  and Kell y (2011) observe, we no longer share a \nuniform worldview  that guarantees agreement on sacredness or \nstandards of behavior. We are talking about a changing worldview, \nrather than a single event or moment in history. This has been a gradual \nprocess. Now, the powerful twentieth century “ Americanism ” is nearly \na misnomer; two persons can share its title and share almost nothing \nelse. The alienation we feel in everyday life suggests that experiences \nof foreignness―exposure to “otherness” of persons or place―are \nbecoming inherent in domestic life. This dovetails with burgeoning \nliterature discussing the disintegration of social candor, “common \ncourtesy” and the sense of locality that made America perceive itself \nas a neighborhood of frankness and fluid exchange. Public intimacy is \nwhat is at stake, the feeling of recognition; understanding, and being \nunderstood, by other human beings.\nZombies are not the first monsters to broach this theme. By and large, \nthey have taken over from a villain H. G.

      "short_summary": "This chapter argues that the zombie is a powerful metaphor for a modern crisis of meaning, which is expressed through four interconnected symbols: the creature itself, its unspoken name, the story's narrative failure, and the apocalypse. Together, these symbols depict a profound loss of the essential components of a meaningful existence—such as language, culture, consciousness, and hope—portraying a world that is unintelligible and devoid of purpose.",
      "long_summary": "Of course. Here is a detailed summary of the chapter \"The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor.\"\n\n### **Chapter 3: The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor - Summary**\n\nThis chapter analyzes the zombie itself as a powerful symbol for the loss of meaning in contemporary Western culture. The author argues that the zombie represents a collection of \"vacancies,\" or empty placeholders for the things that give life meaning. The chapter breaks down the zombie metaphor into four interlocking symbols: the creature itself (its semiotics), its name, its narrative structure (the metanarrative), and its setting (the apocalypse).\n\n---\n\n#### **3.1 The First Symbol: The Semiosis of the Zombie**\n\nThis section breaks down the zombie into eight core characteristics, each representing a specific lack or vacancy.\n\n1.  **Zombies Don’t Talk:** They lack language and have nothing to communicate, symbolizing a loss of intelligibility and shared understanding. They don't just fail to communicate; they actively transmit their own emptiness.\n2.  **Zombies are Communal (but lack Culture):** They move in hordes but have no true community, coordination, or shared purpose. They are together but alone, representing a culture that has lost its unifying narrative and become a collection of isolated individuals.\n3.  **Zombies are Homeless:** Unlike other monsters with lairs or nests, zombies simply drift aimlessly. They don't belong anywhere, symbolizing a feeling of being uprooted and alienated from the world.\n4.  **Zombies Eat Brains:** This represents raw, indiscriminate, and pointless consumption. Their hunger is insatiable but never nourishing; they seek to *have* but never to *be*. The act of eating brains is deeply symbolic: it is mindlessness (driven by the brain) consuming mind (intelligibility). This implies that the threat is internal—humanity devouring itself—leading to the famous line from *The Walking Dead*: \"We are the walking dead.\"\n5.  **Zombies are Ugly:** Their ugliness is not a mask but their very essence, reflecting their inner vacancy. As a debased version of the human form, their physical ugliness symbolizes a deformity of dignity and spirit.\n6.  **Zombies are Not Evil:** They lack malevolent intent. Their destructiveness is mindless and instinctual, like a virus, which makes them more unsettling than a villain who can be understood and fought on moral terms.\n7.  **Zombies are Heedless:** They lack the fundamental instinct of self-preservation, demonstrating a complete disconnect from their own survival.\n8.  **Zombies are Untouchable:** Their contagious nature forces survivors into a state of total isolation. \"Touch\" is the medium of intimacy and our primary metaphor for what is \"real.\" By making touch dangerous, the zombie severs our connections to others and to reality itself.\n\n**Intensifying Meaninglessness: Threat to the Three Marks of Realness**\nThe chapter then argues that these characteristics combine to undermine three fundamental psychological \"marks of realness\"—the ways we feel connected to the world.\n\n*   **Defiance of Intelligibility:** The zombie is a paradox (living/dead, human/non-human), occupying a space between binaries. This logical contradiction makes it impossible to define, which in turn destabilizes the definitions of \"human\" and \"alive,\" making the world less intelligible.\n*   **Defiance of Interaction:** Because the zombie is \"inter-categorical\" (between categories) and contagious, we don't know how to interact with it except through violence and avoidance. This breaks down our ability to connect, fostering alienation and a crisis of intimacy.\n*   **Lack of Interiority:** Drawing from Cartesian philosophy (\"I think, therefore I am\"), the third mark of realness is self-awareness. The zombie is defined by its lack of consciousness and inner life. This vacancy symbolizes a state of mental absence and a severed connection to oneself and the world.\n\nThe section concludes by defining the zombie as a **participatory symbol**—it doesn't just represent meaninglessness; it *enacts* it, and cultural phenomena like \"zombie walks\" invite people to participate in this enactment.\n\n---\n\n#### **3.2 The Second Symbol: The Name of the Zombie**\n\nThis section observes that in most serious zombie films, characters never use the word \"zombie.\" This is significant because, unlike in other horror genres where naming the monster gives heroes power (e.g., knowing it's a vampire means you need a stake), naming the zombie offers no advantage. To name it is simply to acknowledge an unintelligible, hopeless situation, leading only to despair. The one exception noted is the film *Only Lovers Left Alive*, where ancient vampires use the term \"zombies\" disdainfully to describe ordinary, mindless humans, reinforcing the idea that the symbol is truly about us.\n\n---\n\n#### **3.3 The Third Symbol: The Failure of the Metanarrative**\n\nThis symbol relates to the storytelling structure of the zombie genre. A **metanarrative** is the overarching perspective a viewer has that the characters do not, which typically provides insight and a meaningful conclusion (e.g., in a tragedy like *Oedipus Rex*).\n\nIn zombie stories, this metanarrative fails. The viewer knows all the tropes—the survivors will quarrel, the safe haven will fall—but this knowledge provides no deeper meaning or hope. The story is an **anti-tragedy** because it lacks a dignified or meaningful conclusion. It ends not with a resolution but with an endless, pointless drift. The viewer is pushed into a position to find meaning but is given none, creating a sense of despair because we cannot integrate our \"godlike\" perspective with the characters' struggle to create a coherent, hopeful story.\n\n---\n\n#### **3.4 The Fourth Symbol: The Zombie Apocalypse**\n\nThe final symbol is the setting itself. The term \"apocalypse\" has been distorted. Its original Christian meaning included not just destruction but also **revelation and rebirth**. The zombie apocalypse is a perversion of this: it offers resurrection without rebirth, and destruction without revelation.\n\n**Intensifying Meaninglessness II: Lack of Insight**\nThis introduces the fourth \"mark of realness\": **insight**, or the \"light bulb moment\" where our worldview is shattered only to be reformed into a deeper understanding of reality. The zombie apocalypse bankrupts this process. The world breaks, but no new, more profound view emerges. It forecloses the possibility of insight and wonder.\n\nThe chapter traces the evolution of the secular apocalypse from H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds* (where humanity is saved by God) and Cold War films like *On the Beach* (which are bleak but retain human dignity and a moral message) to the modern zombie apocalypse, which strips away all remaining hope, heroism, and intentionality. The zombie and the apocalypse have become fused in an \"unholy marriage,\" creating a palpable cultural backdrop for a world devoid of meaning.\n\n**The Ecology of Worldview**\nThe chapter concludes by defining a **worldview** as a dynamic system between an agent (a person) and an arena (the world), where each makes the other intelligible. A healthy worldview is like a balanced ecology. The zombie apocalypse represents a **worldview crisis**—a total breakdown of the relationship between agent and arena, where actions no longer make sense and the world no longer provides a meaningful context for human life.",
      "chapter_text": "3. The Four Symbols of the  \nZombie Metaphor\nFollowing Christopher Moreman, we note that while there has been much \nacademic discussion of zombie movies, there has been little examination \nof the zombie itself, prompting us to “analyze the zombie as a symbol  in \nitself” (Moreman 2010: 26 4). Motivation is not all that the zombie lacks. \nAs a symbol of the loss of meaning, the zombie embodies a plethora of \nvacancies, empty placeholders for the building blocks of meaning.\n3.1 The First Symbol: The Semiosis of the Zombie\n1. Zombies don’t talk.\nThey aren’t mute or reticent. They simply have no language. \nThey have nothing to say. They don’t transmit gists of conversation. \nCrucially, they do the opposite: they transmit their own vacuity. They \ncommunicate their incommunicability . The zombie’s most marked \npathology is that it lacks intelligibility.\n2. Zombies are communal.\nWith a twist: they possess the momentum and self-organization \nof culture, without the narrative imagination that gathers common \npurpose. Hence, zombies are like culture gone awry. They are communal \ncreatures in that they vaguely share proximity, but there is no accord \namong them (see also Webb and Byrnand 2008). They cannot read in or \nreach out to one another. They do not coordinate to achieve concurrence. \n© 2017 J. Vervaeke, C. Mastropietro, F.

Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n14 \nZombies in Western Culture\nThey are in company, but not together. They are surrounded, but each \nalone. They lack culture.\n3. Zombies are homeless.\nZombies do not have lairs, nests, coffins, castles or caves. They do \nnot retreat anywhere as sun breaks the horizon, as the moon breaks \nthe clouds or as the spring breaks the winter. Zombies drift. They are \nequally suited, and unsuited, to the ground they occupy. They do not \nhave province in any one space (see also Webb and Byrnand 2008). They \ndo not have propriety for any one person. There is nothing whatsoever \nabout a zombie that appears to belong to the world. A zombie simply \n“shuffles”, bungles absently from one place to the next. If zombies were \nhuman, they might be feeling a little uprooted. But perhaps we can \nunderstand a portion of their plight. Not belonging anywhere, being \nfrom  anywhere… this is precisely part of the encroaching foreignness \nwe described in section 2 . Zombies lack home.\n4. Zombies eat brains.\nThe appetite of a zombie is a very particular kind of appetite. No \nmatter how much a zombie devours, it will continue feeding for as long \nas it is able. Its gormandizing is indiscriminate and voracious, and its \nfamishment apparently bottomless. But it is insubstantial. The zombie \nrepresents raw consumption. It does not seem to imbibe the things it \nconsumes; it simply extinguishes them. A zombie never stops eating, \nbut never grows or changes. In its insatiability, the zombie has put its \nface to the disorder of addiction. It craves with absolute singularity, and \nits craving becomes its nature. It wants to have, but never to be (see also \nFromm 1976). It is constantly filling, but never gets full. The zombie’s \nlack has become a hunger (see also Webb and Byrnand 2008). In fact, in \none pivotal scene1 in Day of the Dead ,\nthe pointlessness of the zombie appetite [is made apparent] as one \ncaptured zombie continues to try to eat despite the fact that its internal \norgans have been removed and so the ‘‘food’’ simply drops to the floor \nupon being swallowed . (Moreman 2010: 275)\n1    Scene available at https://gomovies.to/film/day-of-the-dead-1985-17728/watching.\nhtml?ep=549712  at 22:57.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 15\n 3. The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\nZombies are a brain-oriented monster, in operation, appetite and \nvulnerability. Interestingly, in many accounts of the zombie, the only \nway to kill a zombie is by destroying its brain―if you will: obliterating \nmind to obliterate mindlessness . We can find a strange twist tucked into \nthis pattern: that the mindlessness evinced by the zombie is begotten \nby its brain. Zombies are a perversion of mind precisely because they \nnotably lack the properties of mind we think fundamentally human, yet \nthey visibly want to acquire mind in the most literal sense of acquisition. \nOnly by destroying their brains do you destroy the threat to your \nbrains posed by their mindlessness. What is being intimated here is a \nvery unsettling dependency between the threat of mindlessness and \nthe possessing of mind. The brain is a symbol  for intelligibility. The \ndevouring of the brain indicates the devouring of that intelligibility and \nall it affords. The fact that brain is driving the consumption of brain \nis a deeply complex symbolic occurrence; culture is devouring culture, \nmind is devouring mind, humanness is devouring humanness. This \nevinces a deep presence of mindlessness within mind. Implicitly, it tells \nus that zombies are not an external threat, but an internal one. They are \na symbolic villain that assumes most characteristics of humanity, and \nsubverts them with decay. As one character in The Walking Dead  points \nout to his fellow survivors:2 “We are the walking dead” (see also Goto-\nJones 2015; Moreman 2010; Webb and Byrnand 2008).\n5. Zombies are ugly.\nThis is the operative difference between the zombie and most other \npopular horrors. Vampires are flushed with sex appeal, Frankenstein’s \nmonster  is endearing, and in its exotic way, even the werewolf  is a \nbeauteous animal. But zombies are ugly by definition: dead, rotting, \nstinking, without vitals, lacking the spirit that makes one human being \nattractive to another. A zombie is not guilty of concealment or duplicity. \nThe ugly mug does not sheath any hidden depths. The essence of a \nzombie shares the visage of its appearance. Ugliness  is the zombie’s \nnature. We cannot see the mind of a zombie because they have no \nmind to see. The vacancy in a zombie’s gaze provides a window to the \nabsence of soul.\n2    Season 5, episode 10 is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=AyYuvILOgck\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n16 \nZombies in Western Culture\nThe enduring disconcertment is the fact that zombies look like us. \nThey do not just happen  to look like us; therein froths the real potency \nof the metaphor. Zombies are something inhuman in human form―not \njust ugly, but ugly in the image of person. Dehumanization makes the \nzombie more destitute than the ugliest orc, that they are a debasement \nof cosmetic sensibilities. And the zombie upends all  cosmos in human \nnature. Physical ugliness is its deformity of dignity. Mindlessness is \ndeformity of the intelligible. The human guise of a zombie aborts human \nfeeling. It reviles contact. It brings us to a dead end.\n6. Zombies are not evil.\nUnlike the conspiring alien , the deceptive vampire , or the malevolent \nspirit, the zombie lacks the defining characteristic of monstrous villainy: \nit lacks evil. Because of its mindlessness , the zombie does not possess \nmalevolence; even as it drags itself forward in consumption, it is merely \nscrabbling to satisfy a base instinct of its own craving. But it does not do \nso with the awareness of malintent. The destructiveness of the zombie’s \nimpact is no more known to it than a bacterial infection is known to \nthe culpable bacteria. The zombie, dangerous, hideous and destructive \nthough it is, intuitively defies the category of evil. Despite the twisted \nresemblance to its living counterpart, the zombie is no more evil than a \nrabid animal.\n7. Zombies are heedless .\nZombies are fierce and threatening, but not self-preserving. They \ngive no thought to defending themselves against harm. In this sense, \nthey lack the defining feature of a living organism. They bear no \nfundamental relationship to their survival. In pursuit of consumption \nthey will destroy themselves (see also Webb and Byrnand 2008).\n8. Zombies are untouchable.\nTheir ugliness is catchable, and they have a 100% rate of contagion. \nIf you come into contact with a zombie, infection follows inevitably. We \ndon’t want to be ugly, mindless, homeless or incommunicable , so when \nconfronted with a zombie, we take care to keep our distance. But the \ndeprivation of closeness is severely consequential. If we are to suppose \nthat the monster really has been created in our image, then it poses \nseveral complications to our yen for touch.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 17\n 3. The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\nOur penchant for touch is, ultimately, what distinguishes intimate \nrelationships from non-intimate ones, not only relationships with \npeople, but with animals, objects, and concepts. The more “in touch” we \nare with something, the closer and more connected we are to that thing. \nTouch is the medium of intimacy. Without it, it is hard to imagine that \nintimacy could exist at all. However, intimacy is not the only casualty of \nthe zombie’s untouchableness.\nOur being in the world is heavily dependent upon touch to keep \na continuity of contact with our surroundings. Experience is deemed \n“true” when it impresses  us through contact. We come to believe \nsomething as a result of having touched it, literally or otherwise. We \ncome to be affected by it once it has “touched us” in turn. And of course, \nwe don’t consider our relationships to be loving relationships until we \nfeel comfortable with touching one another.\nTouch is the arbiter of “real”. Assertions of verity are always made \nwith permutations of a touch metaphor. Those with whom we are \nintimate are more real to us. Objects we have handled  are more real to \nus. Emotions we have felt are more real to us. Losing touch costs us our \ngrasp on reality.\n3.1.1 Intensifying Meaninglessness: Zombies as a Threat \nto the Three Marks of Realness\nRealness  is a multivalent term. Conversationally, it is often used in \nreference to qualities of lucidity that are not captured by its ontological \ndefinition, which refers strictly to truth and falsehood. When an \nindividual says that something feels “real” she is seldom referring \nto whether something is verifiable. Instead, she refers to a sense of \nconnection, a way in which her felt experience relates to patterns or \nevents in the world. This relating  is often described with reference \nto propositions of truth and falseness, but this is only a reference in \nmetaphor. A “sense of realness ” is a psychological experience, not a \nmetaphysical principle.\nOur sense of touch is an apt analogue for this psychological \nexperience, and the symbol  of the zombie has appropriated it. The \ncontact implied by touch represents a quality of relation that is integral \nto feelings of connection; meaning. Metaphorically, touch is a versatile \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n18 \nZombies in Western Culture\nenough source domain to represent both cerebral and physical forms of \nrelating . The zombie co-opts this versatility. The felt sense of realness  \nis not a single impression, but a series of marks that relate to (i) the \nintelligible, (ii) the interactional, the (iii) interior and (iv) the insight-\naffording connections that orient our actions in the world. The nature \nof the zombie undermines each of these marks. It poses a paradox \nthat undercuts intelligibility, it has an inter-categorical  nature that \nconfuses our interaction, it vacuums our interior presence of mind, and \nit bankrupts us of a promised capacity to use insight to transcend the \nboundaries of outmoded perspectives. We will discuss the first three \nmarks in this section, and the fourth in section 3.4.1 .\n3.1.1.1 The Zombie is Paradoxical; It Defies Intelligibility\nIntelligibility as an explicitly discussed concept began in many ways \nwith Plato ’s dialogues. It refers to the rational confirmation of reality \nand its contents, the form in which the world is represented reflectively \nin human cognition. To the degree that our minds grasp the form of \nsomething, can identify it notionally based on distinguishable properties, \nwe would say that the thing is intelligible; readable by our minds.\nThe zombie defies rational confirmation because it lacks the coherence \nof properties that allow us to form rational definitions. The nature of the \nzombie is beset by paradox; it is human and non-human, living and not \nliving, cultural and non-cultural, natural and supernatural , suspended \nbetween fundamental binaries that most definitions presuppose.\nLiving ––––––––––––––– [zombie] ––––––––––––––– Non-living\nThe zombie not only eludes a definition of its own, it also disrupts \nthe definitional integrity maintained by the binaries it is suspended \nbetween: if the zombie is both alive and not alive, what now does it \nmean to be “alive”? And if it is both human and non-human, what then \ndoes it mean to be “human”?\nHuman ––––––––––––––– [zombie] ––––––––––––––– Non-human\nIntelligibility allows us to see the world with conceptual clarity. The \ndefinition of the zombie is unintelligible, which means that any likeness \nassociated with the zombie is distorted by that association, like an \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The \ncontradictions of the zombie provoke a disconfirmation, a kind of black \nhole within its intelligibility that vacuums any elements that have been \ntethered to its likeness, including and especially its humanity. The \nzombie’s influence disrupts the binary relationship of the human and \nnon-human. This raises the question “what is the difference between \nthe human and the zombie?” Our sense of realness  in our humanity can \nquickly be destabilized by the zombie’s presence.\nThe zombie paradox is not just problematic from the safety of its \nfiction. The zombie is very nearly human, enough to be a moniker \nfor certain human states and behaviors. Consider, for example, how \nfrequently we use “zombie” to describe stupors of illness, fatigue or \nmental dysfunction, and consider the similarities to the destitution of \nthe monster. Like the alien , the zombie walks a line between natural \nand supernatural , and our incredulousness toward it seems tentative \nenough for the monster to be hypothesized as a genuine biological \nterror. Therefore, the paradox of the zombie not only rests upon the \nquestion “is it human?” but also upon the question “does it exist at all?”\nThis paradox is the prime potency of the zeitgeist, the axle upon \nwhich all other symbols of the zombie rotate. The likeness and unlikeness \nto humanness are both uncanny. The zombie is not only a paradox by \ndefinition (or lack thereof), but also in its epistemological intrusiveness: \nthe monster cannot be disconfirmed. We cannot be sure that such a thing \nexists, or does not exist. Moreover, if it does  exist, we cannot be sure it \nis not simply ourselves, a distorted reflection in the pond on the other \nside of the non-human spectrum. The paradox of the zombie defies the \nintelligible. It defies a consistent, conceptual sense of realness .\n3.1.1.2 The Zombie is Inter-categorical; It Defies Interaction\nThe zombie’s paradoxical place on the spectrum between human and \nnon-human, existent and non-existent, and natural and supernatural , \nundermines a second mark of realness . The zombie is an inter-categorical  \nmonster―it is perpetually in-between categories, neither one thing nor \nits opposite. Intelligibility is required for rational confirmation, but for \nsomething to seem real, representation is not sufficient. Simply put: we \nneed to know what things are so that we know how to encounter them. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

There is a sensual dimension \nto realness. Understanding is not enough; we need to be able to interact \nwith the world.\nThe kind of contact provided by interaction is not an intellectual \nkind, but the kind that relates to action. The sense of realness  is an \nembodied sense, not simply a cerebral one. The world must not only \nmake sense, it must have  sense. It must not only be represented, it must \nalso be reciprocated. It must be touchable, and it must touch us in turn.\nThis is where the inter-categorical  nature of the zombie interferes \nwith our sense of realness : it encumbers our ability to interact. We noted \nin the previous section  that contagion is among the zombie’s more salient \nfeatures, and within the monster’s narrative, survivors who encounter \na zombie must avoid touching it at all costs. The more multitudinous \nthe zombies become, the more this danger is compounded. In a world \ninhabited by the zombie, the physicality of touch becomes an undying \nhazard. Ordinary humans are constantly at risk of exposure, and are \ntherefore zombies in waiting. This is a world that discourages contact in \nall of its forms and bucks the rituals of interaction. For this reason, the \nzombie represents a crisis of intimacy. We treat everyone like a stranger \nin this world because it is the only way to avoid infection. In this world, \nwe are surrounded and yet stranded, inundated while utterly alone. \nThis simultaneity of the zombie’s presence and absence is an inter-\ncategorical problem laid over the paradox of its unintelligible definition. \nNot only is the zombie―and by extension, its human foils―unclear and \ndisconfirming, it is also profoundly alienating.\n3.1.1.3 The Zombie is Vacant; It Lacks Interiority\nOf the many paradigmatic influences that have trained our sense of \nrealness , Cartesian has been perhaps the most pivotal. Much of the \nWestern philosophical tradition continues to lean on the metaphysical \nand epistemological framework laid by Descartes  treatises. The cogito \nergo sum  of Descartes’ Meditations is one of those maxims in Western \nphilosophy distinguished by its rare notoriety; its philosophical \nimport on the question of “what is real?” is still the prime reference for \nenlightenment philosophy, not just within the annals of academic work, \nbut for the broader culture and its epistemic presuppositions.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 21\n 3. The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\nThe Cartesian tradition sets out the third of our fundamental marks \nof realness : clear and distinct intellectual perception. At the center of \nthis mark is the phenomenon of metacognition, the mind’s ability to \nrecognize and reflect back on itself. This self-recognition of consciousness \nis the individual’s awareness of himself, his existence, and his capacity \nto think and, therefore, to be. To Descartes , this fundamental criterion \nwas a kind of charter with reality, an ontological base camp from which \nto brave the wilds of a potentially duplicitous world. The interior of the \ncamp was the individual’s certainty of his own realness.\nThe zombie defies this mark of realness  perhaps more obviously \nthan any other, and in so doing it builds upon its paradox from the \nprevious marks. A lack of human consciousness is definitive of the \nzombie, particularly because it is otherwise so strikingly human in \nappearance. It is because of this trait more than any other that the \nzombie becomes the source domain for human debasement―the literal \nlack of consciousness is a symbol  for states of mental absence, fugue and \nfatigue that have become idiomatically synonymous with zombification. \nThe most common reason we refer to someone as a zombie is that he \ndoesn’t seem fully conscious. He is not aware of himself. He does not \nnotice the world go by.\nThe zombie lacks an inner life, an interior presence of mind that \nis commensurate with thought, intention and direction. The zombie’s \ninner vacancy is symbolized by a blank stare and shifting movement, \ndriven by unreflective, sub-human cravings. The lack of interiority \nmeans that the zombie cannot connect to the world, it cannot affirm \nits own realness  by the Cartesian criterion, and it cannot affirm the \nrealness of its environment. Turned on the individual, this lack is wholly \ndestructive. Her connection with the world is severed at the stem, and \nshe cannot even be sure of herself, let alone a world beyond her. An \nexistence without interiority is a disconfirmed existence. It lacks even \nthe most basic constituents on which to build the foundation for a sense \nof realness.\nIt is important to understand that the zombie symbolically undermines \neach of these marks of realness . The zombie is a participatory symbol . \nBy this we mean it invokes and invites action. It does not simply refer \nto but also instantiates the object of its reference, whether the object \nis paradox, destitution, homelessness  or alienation. A participatory \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n22 \nZombies in Western Culture\nsymbol is more active than a regular symbol; a valentine heart and a kiss \nare both common symbols for love, yet the shape of a valentine heart \nplays no causal role in love itself, whereas a kiss instigates intimacy. \nSimilarly, the zombie is a participatory symbol because it enacts the \nphenomenon to which it refers. It does not only stand in for these \ndegenerations, it also demonstrates them. In our own enactments, we in \nturn demonstrate the zombie.\nActivities like the urban zombie walks speak to all that is participatory \nabout the zombie symbol . The simulations in which humans deliberately \nundermine their own humanity add salience to the zombie’s defiance of \nrealness . While such playacting may be dismissed as frivolous, it is also \npossible that these acts are trying to draw attention to a resemblance. \nWhen we take our attention away from the mindless walkers long \nenough to look around at their human counterparts, we are perhaps \nmeant to genuinely wonder the difference.\n3.2 The Second Symbol: The Name of the Zombie\nThis brings us to our next observation of zombies in popular fiction, \nthough in fact it is more of an observation about our survivors. You \nmay have noticed that zombies are almost never “zombies”. No one \nin film (save the more comedic renderings) ever refers to a zombie as a \nzombie. They refer to “walkers”, “the dead”, “the undead”, “corpses”, \n“flesh-eaters” or “the infected”. But they never use the most common \ncultural term. In fact, they seem wholly unfamiliar with the concept of \na zombie until the apocalypse  befalls them. They are ignorant to the \ntropes associated with the genre of their distress. It is often remarked \nstrange and amusing that no one in a zombie movie―set in the same \ntime and world we live in―seems ever to have seen a zombie movie.\nThere have been few exceptions to the absence of the term \n“zombie”, but each of these exceptions demonstrates the instability \nof how the term is used. Once again, even in name the zombies \ncommunicate their incommunicability . The first exception is World \nWar Z. Uncharacteristically, zombies are here referred to by name, \nbut the characters are quite reluctant to use the term. When they find \nthemselves speaking the name of “zombie” the heroes are ill at ease. \nWhy this reluctance? Traditionally in horror movies, characters are \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 23\n 3. The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\nreticent to utter the name of the monster because of the sheer disbelief \nin supernatural  agents. However, coming to believe in the vampire  \nor the werewolf  is often the first step in empowering the resistance to \nthe monsters (as soon as the hero knows she is facing a vampire, she \nknows to arm herself with a crucifix and wooden stake). In contrast, \nthe zombie is not supernatural, nor hard to detect. In World War Z  (as \nin most films of the genre) the protagonists are surround by hundreds \nif not thousands of zombies, so there is no cause for disbelief. Nor \ndoes naming the monster provide any empowerment. Absent these \ntraditional reasons, an alternative explanation for the reluctance is \nneeded. Using the term of “zombie” opens a gap in the intelligibility \nof the world, a vacancy that cannot thereafter be filled. In a traditional \nhorror movie the monster disrupts the order of the characters’ world, \nbut in acknowledging the monster’s existence, the characters are able to \nreorder the world to accommodate the supernatural disruption. The evil \nof the monster becomes a normative guidance; it inspires the effective \nrighteousness of the protagonists. This accommodation is not a passive \nacquiescence, but an active and effective resistance. The characters can \nnow fight back. However, acknowledging the zombie―who is not \nevil―brings no accommodation, and yields no empowerment. To use \nthe term is to despair.\nAnother exception is the film Only Lovers Left Alive . It was directed by \nJim Jarmusch  and released in 2013 to critical acclaim.3 The film features \ntwo centuries’ old vampires, Adam and Eve, languishing uneventfully \nthrough eternity. When the term “zombie” makes its appearance, it \nis used not by a human hero, but by one of literature’s oldest horror \nmonsters. The vampires use it disdainfully, not in reference to the usual \nundead creatures, but to ordinary humans. These fanged beings, whose \nlives appear as meaningless  as they are enduring, find the lives of their \nhuman contemporaries even more meaningless. Their contempt for our \nzombie behavior is casual and matter-of-fact. The malaise of human life \nis, at least to the vampires, an obvious and unquestioned fact. The name \nof “zombie” is used explicitly and without reluctance only in this case: \nwhen it is made to describe human life. We are the walking dead .\n3    A trailer is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=ycOKvWrwYFo\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

All rights reserved. \n24 \nZombies in Western Culture\nWhen we examine this closely, we begin to realize that the \nzombie zeitgeist is not a single symbol , but a dynamic constellation \nof interlocking symbols. The creature of the zombie is the icon of the \nzeitgeist, and as we have explained, the name of the zombie also carries \na symbolic conveyance that embellishes the phenomenon. We might say \nthat these are the first two symbols in the constellation. The next two \nsymbols are more diffuse in their representation. The third symbol is \nthe relation between the viewer and the zombie genre as she encounters \nit. The fourth symbol is the apocalypse , which is often paired with \nthe zombie, and has given rise the conjoined catchphrase, “zombie \napocalypse”. Independently and in concert, these symbols speak for the \nmeaning crisis.\n3.3 The Third Symbol: The Failure of the \nMetanarrative\nAs she follows a story, the viewer integrates two different perspectives \nin order to gain both involvement and reflection. The viewer has the \nperspective of the characters in the story, but also a “godlike” perspective \nbeyond that possessed by any character. The relationship between these \ntwo perspectives can be called the metanarrative  of the story. The interplay \nbetween these perspectives affords the viewer a kind of participatory \ninsight. This insight in turn inspires a transformation in the viewer. The \nmetanarrative binds the viewer to the meaning of the story. However, in \nthe zombie story there is no transformation. In the zombie story, the two \nperspectives clash. In the zombie story, the metanarrative fails to bind.\nThe first stage of any outbreak story is the survivor’s struggle to \novercome her disorientation and create a profile of her adversary. The \nviewer’s distress of a zombie film is to watch the inevitable unfold―\nthe story begins by focusing on a single character through a window \nof momentary normalcy. The rising action begins with a very sudden \nappearance of the outbreak, which the character narrowly manages to \nescape. After a period of isolation, the character meets other escapees \nwho share information, and the survivors converge on a working \nperspective of the crisis and their predator. They find some advantageous \nhaven with renewable means of sustenance, and they attempt to fortify \nit. They delegate roles and try to live as a community.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 25\n 3. The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\nBut it’s never to be, because the survivors quarrel. They dissent over \ntrivialities and their tenuous order fails. Conflict divides them into \nfactions, and selfishness breeds mistrust. Usually by some oversight, \nthe wayward survivors alert the zombies to their whereabouts and \nonce again become overrun. Their tentative home disintegrates. They \nstruggle to escape and go on the run, and zombies follow in pursuit. \nThe film reaches its climax as the survivors become desperate and \noverwhelmed. Most of them fall. The film ends either with the death or \ninfection of the remaining survivors, or with a suggestion of the peril’s \nceaselessness: that there will only ever be more of the same: fighting… \nevading… trying to outrun the inevitable (see also Moreman 2010; Webb \nand Byrnand 2008).\nThe final revelation of the film extinguishes the last feelings of \nhope. The survivor feels―as the viewer knows―that there is no land \nleft untouched. There is no one immune from infection. There is no \ngarden to flee to, no island of retreat. There is nowhere left to hide, and \nthere is nothing more to tell. Much like the zombie, the story drifts off \nas we realize the outbreak is unending. The credits roll ambiguously \nthereafter.\nStories of the zombie always begin close in and zoom out gradually. \nWe follow a single character as she intakes more and more of her \nsituation’s horror. As the camera and story pan, the situation darkens. \nChances of survival become less and less likely, and the prospect of \nsalvation becomes bleaker. The story ends as it began, with calamity. \nBut it does not grant us a final understanding. The story ends, but it \nrefuses to conclude.\nWe watch all of this happen as knowing spectators. We know the \nwalkers are zombies and we know better than to confuse them with \nhumans. We know they eat insatiably and we know they grow in \nnumber. We understand the threat before our fictional counterparts \nexperience it, and we look for the firearm long before the survivors \nacquire it. We anticipate shelter before the survivors find it. We know \nit will be fruitless as the survivors brace it. We know the survivors will \nnot sustain community. We know the zombies will win by attrition. We \nknow these things as we would of any other fictional horror, but there is a \ndiscrepancy in that the survivors know none of it. There is a vast distance \nbetween us and the survivors because they are incapable of sharing our \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

This is another clue that the human survivors are not quite \nequal in elevation to the culture that authors them. We know more than \nthey do. We see as they do not. Like watching Oedipus  Rex, we have the \nexpectation of incoming tragedy. We have the feeling of dramatic irony. \nWe can predict the failure of the survivors before they fail.\nAnd yet… it’s not really like Oedipus . It’s not a tragedy. Because while \nwe can predict the survivors’ failure, we are no better at understanding \nit than they are. We certainly cannot predict anything beyond it. And we \ncannot quite call it ironic either. The absence of a conclusion breaks the \npattern that defines dramatic irony, namely comparing the character’s \napprehensions against the coming of a contrary result. But the zombie \nhas no final result. It has no finality at all. Only drift. Tragedy is marked \nby a metanarrative , an overseen conclusion that makes sense of the \nevents leading up to it. Metanarratives provide a frame for the story, \nbut the zombie outbreak cannot be framed. We don’t know where it \nhas come from, and we don’t know where it is going save that it will \ncontinue to consume, continue to engulf, delete, and die. Zombies \nbring not just death, they bring  interminable death. The waves of a \nzombie apocalypse  are always falling, without purpose, and without \nend. Tragedy is an afterword ascribed to events of dramatic suffering, \na denouement that dignifies the events of suffering by giving them \nsignificance. The zombie apocalypse is the anti-tragedy. It immerses us \nin a story and denies us closure. It invests us into the face of character \nand has us look on as the face deforms. It has us watch as the eyes of our \nprotagonists glaze and go blank. It has us hope for the redemption of \nthe human survivors, and ever so slowly, it takes that hope away. The \nzombie is an aesthetic for the deepest despair because it chokes on a \nmeaningful  story. It pushes us into the position of a metanarrative, and \nthen withholds the metanarrative from us.\nEven though we identify the tropes, our savvy is otherwise unhelpful \nbecause nothing of our irony would assist a survivor in the long run. We \ncan predict the failure of the narrative and the absence of conclusion, \nbut we have nothing to offer in its place. And that, more than anything, \nis a cause for despair. We cannot transpose ourselves into the crisis and \nbe sure of a more meaningful  experience. Even at a safe distance, our \nanxiety and uncertainty disable us because against all reason, we cannot \nhelp but to dread the absurdity of their predicament, and to wonder how \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

We cannot integrate the perspective of the characters \nwith the perspective of the viewer. There is no participatory insight or \ntransformation. There is no meaningful connection.\n3.4 The Fourth Symbol: The Zombie Apocalypse\nFig. 4: Ludwig Ferdinand Schnorr von Carolsfeld’s depiction of the \nApocalypse with Jesus ( ca. 1831).4\nToday, the term “apocalypse ” is applied extemporaneously.5 It usually \nrefers to the end of the world, of human civilization, or a range of \ncalamities and disasters. This is a telling inaccuracy. The definition of \napocalypse as a synonym for destruction only captures one axis of its \nbiblical origins. The Christian  apocalypse was never simply the end of \nthe world: it was the resurrection  of the body, and the revelation of final \ntruths. Just as the zombie’s mug distorts the cosmos of human likeness, \nthe zombie zeitgeist distorts the cosmos of apocalyptic revelation, by \noffering resurrection without rebirth (see also Moreman 2010). \n3.4.1 Intensifying Meaninglessness II: The Zombie is \nBankrupt; It Lacks Insight \nThe Christian  apocalypse  is the breaking of an old worldview  to \nafford the emergence of a new worldview. As such, it represents \nthe mutual transformation of mind and world.

These so-called light bulb moments are instances of “insight”, \nand the phenomenology of this experience gives us the fourth and \nfinal mark of realness .\nThis mark of realness  is best described as a sense of wonder. When \nthe world cedes us something from beyond the frame of our existing \nperspectives, our sense of ontological surprise is deeply significant. \nWhile it is crucial for us to have a grasp on the world, it is also crucial \nfor the world to escape that grasp so that our mapping of reality can \nbe recast and recaptured. The feeling that there is more to reality than \nwhat we know of it strengthens its integrity, and its independence \nfrom our subjectivity makes it more trustworthy. While it is necessary, \nas discussed above, to feel that the world is consistently intelligible, \nit is also necessary to have our sense of the world pulled periodically \nfrom underneath us. Insight emerges from the wreckage of this \nexperience. It allows our perspective to reframe itself around a fuller \nappreciation of reality, like stepping out from behind a camera, or \nlosing your footing only to regain it with more traction. \nThe traditional apocalypse  is the religious macrocosm of this \nperspectival shifting, but the zombie apocalypse bankrupts it. The \nworld of the zombie decays but there is no revelation to redeem the \nfall. When the frame around reality is shattered, it is left asunder \nand never reformed. The realness  marked by insight is foreclosed by \nthe utter limpness of the zombie’s world, where there is no longer \nsustained vitality or the ethos of industry. There is some property \nto this world that lacks the dynamism for creation and reinvention. \nNature overgrows but nothing cultural grows from it. There is no \ncosmic insight that pulls back the veil on the working of reality. The \nzombie apocalypse breaks the world without enhancing the view, \nand resurrects the body without bringing the abundant life that Jesus \npromised.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\n3.4.2 The History of the Zombie Apocalypse\nFig. 5: Depiction of the Martian invasion of H. G. Wells ’ 1898 classic, The \nWar of the Worlds. Illustration by Alvim Corréa, from the 1906 French \nedition of the novel.6 \nThe zombie is not fiction’s first instance of a secular apocalypse . It \nhas evolved from a modern zeitgeist that has toyed with the aesthe tic \nof apo calypse while gradually abandoning its Christian  matrix. \nOstwalt (1995, 2000) argues that the secular apocalypse is one that \ncan be averted by human ingenuity and science. The genesis of this \ntradition was perhaps H. G. Wells ’ War of the Worlds , published in \n6  Wikimedia, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:War_of_the_Worlds_shoot.jpeg\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

Notably though, Wells’ novel is not completely secular; in the \nafterword of its epilogue, the plague that kills the Martians is declared \nto be the providence of God. The first true secular apocalypse instead \nemerges halfway through the twentieth century from deep within \nthe wariness of the Cold War . Unlike in War of the Worlds , the threat \nof nuclear annihilation is completely manmade, and in the absence \nof an interloping villain, this apocalypse withholds the opportunity \nfor any classic form of human heroism. Perhaps no film depicts this \nnew variety of bleakness more potently than Stanley Kramer ’s 1959 \nfilm On the Beach .7 This atomic-age story about the end of the world \nis one of film’s first tragedies without deliverance. Crucially though, \nwhile the world depicted on screen perishes into the atomic cloud, \nthe film retains a noble consciousness. The characters accept their fate \nwith affirmation and dignity in their humanity. More importantly, \nthe film arcs to a higher order purpose that transcends the frame of \nits narrative―it implores us, the viewers, to heed the warning of its \ntragedy and intervene against the corresponding threats in the real \nworld. In its depiction of humanity, and the drive of its metanarrative  \n(in contrast to the zombie films), the story of this apocalypse retains \na vital kind of intentionality. This is where the zombie narrative \ndiffers. The zombie apocalypse exhausts the remains of hopefulness, \nhowever frail, found in these preceding stories. It is the culmination of \nunhallowed endings; gone is the providence and h eroism of  Wells, and \ngone is the dignified finality of nuclear twilight. As Moreman (2010: \n271), following Charles Mitchell, argues, “[t]he zombie apocalypse \nis one that allows for the success of no human ingenuity”. We have \nalready discussed the viewers’ impotence in the face of the zombie \napocalypse―there is no metanarrative imperative inspired by these \nstories and no swell of human fellowship to offer emotional resonance. \nThe ending is not punctuated by informed irony or moralism. It is \nsimply the end.\n7    Available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue8hC5qqMt4&list=\nPL_7mZVLEeOA1cJDEDL-WIZppvxBNiuSKE\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The modern zombie apocalypse is the co-emerged \npairing of a certain kind of creature to a certain kind of world. The \nworld depicted within the zombie apocalypse is an analogue to the \nzombie itself, causative of the creature, and created by it. This complex \ndynamic has been conditioned by a generation of successive films that \nhave resewn the genre into the tropes we now recognize. Three of the \nearliest zombie films mark this transition significantly:\n• Night of the Living Dead ―1968: George Romero ’s classic is the \nbirth of the modern zombie proper: mindless, undead corpses \nthat move laboriously and devour human flesh. Though \nradioactive contamination is implied, the cause of their \nanimation is unclear and ultimately peripheral. Apocalypse \nthreatens, but does not ensue.9\n8    From Google N-Gram Viewer, smoothing factor of 3 (Michel et al.  2011).\n9    Trailer available on YouTube  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob8vZhSjES8  \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

Here the \nzombie-apocalypse causality becomes more pronounced. Yet \nthe zombification is not complete. The zombies are murderous \nbut not mindless, anti-cultural but not yet acultural. Though \nit follows Romero’s perversion of Christian  resurrection , the \nfilm does not altogether abandon its sanctity, and ends by \ngrasping at the symbol  of a Christian sacrifice.10\n• Dawn of the Dead ―1978 : Romero’s sophomore effort gives us \nthe first fully-fledged zombie apocalypse . By now, the nuclear \novertones have faded away, and there is no exterior witness \nto intervene. The cause of the zombie outbreak is unknown \nand the fate of the human survivors, far from hopeful, is also \nunknown.11 \nAs though magnetized to one another, zombies and the apocalypse  have \nbeen drawn into an unholy marriage  despite their unrelated origins. \nTheir affinity is now so deeply cast that storytellers are hard pressed to \ninvoke one without attracting the other, like flies to rotting food. Even \ntwo more recent post-apocalyptic films, whose conceit had nothing to \ndo with the undead, featured startling, accidental depictions of human \nzombification: The Road  (2009), based on Cormac McCarthy ’s Pulitzer \nPrize winning novel, and Mad Max : Fury Road (2015) both take place in \na post-apocalyptic future, and although neither of these films include \nthe resurrection  of corpses, both give us a glimpse of a non-literal, \nhuman zombification―in The Road , the degenerating of the species \ninto barbarous, subcultural cannibals, and in Mad Max , into scurrying, \ninsect-like creatures that gather to idols of a primitive religion.

The Four Symbols of the Zombie Metaphor\ngenre so iconic and palpable, that to plot your narrative in the not-so-\ndistant future of the zombie apocalypse is now akin to―and the precise \ninverse of―beginning your story with the line “a long time ago in a \ngalaxy far, far away”. \nThe term has become a common object of cultural reference that is as \ncasually recognized as The Beatles , Star Wars  or Harry Potter . The clime \nof fiction of course has a permeable membrane, and the zeitgeist has \nalready moved beyond it. The zombie apocalypse  is now the mise-en-\nscène for the popular theatre of survivalism and disaster preparation. \nOutdoor survival camps and fitness programs frequently use zombie \napocalypse as their chosen terrain. Governments have even used the \nzeitgeist as a tableau to drum up interest in evacuation policy and \ndisaster management procedures. Yet, the theatre of a zombie apocalypse \nis not so much about donning the attire of a fantasy as it is removing the \nattire of civility. Despite the elaborate makeup, the theatrics of zombie \nwalking are more about stripping down the world than they are about \ndressing it up. There are no interesting accessories or architecture that \nhelps to raise the pretend world from fantasy because the world of the \nzombie apocalypse is less, not more, adorned. The zeitgeist is altogether \nugly, and that makes even the more tasteful zombie enactments an \neffacing kind of art form.\n3.4.3 The Ecology of Worldview\nThe relationship between the zombie and the apocalypse  is the obverse \nrelation of a dynamical system that exists between  an individual and \nthe world she inhabits. This dynamical system is what the cultural \ntheologian Brian Walsh (2006), following anthropologist Clifford Geertz , \ncalls a worldview . A worldview is two things simultaneously: (1) a \nmodel of the world and (2) a model for acting in that world. It turns the \nindividual into an agent who acts, and it turns the world into an arena \nin which those actions make sense. A worldview typically structures \nthe environment to provide affordances  for an agent; situations in the \nworld are foregrounded with implicit guidance as to how an agent \nshould address and interact with them. Meanwhile, the worldview \ntypically structures the individual into an agent; it foregrounds and \nconfigures the behavior of the individual into coherent action that \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n34 \nZombies in Western Culture\nresonates with the affordances of the world. Fit together, the agent \nand arena mutually make sense of one another, and ratify each other’s \nexistence and intelligibility. The configuring effect of a worldview is \npresent even in the simplest of actions: a man cuts some flowers and \ncarries them to his dwelling. He gives the flowers to the woman who \ndwells there with him. Under the acuity lens of their worldview, an \notherwise rudimentary act becomes the prism for a transfiguration that \ndeepens the nature of their relation to one another. With the giving of \nthe flowers, many significations take place: the man is transformed \ninto the lover, she into the beloved, their dwelling into a home, and the \nflowers into a celebration. \nThe worldview  is the cultural analogue of an ecology. The attunement \nbetween the agent and the arena mirrors the Darwinian fittedness \nbetween an organism and its ecological niche. A fluid worldview is akin \nto a healthy and balanced ecology. Just as there is the possibility for an \necological crisis, there is also a possibility for a worldview crisis. The \nzombie apocalypse  represents such a crisis. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017.

      "long_summary": "This is a detailed summary of the chapter \"A Worldview in Crisis: The Domicide of Apocalypse.\"\n\n### Overall Argument\n\nThe chapter introduces and defines the concept of **\"domicide\"**—the destruction of home—as the most suitable term for understanding a \"worldview crisis\" or \"meaning crisis.\" The authors expand the definition of \"home\" from a physical dwelling to a metaphorical one, representing the entire cultural and cosmic framework that gives individuals a sense of place, identity, and intelligibility. Using two case studies—the modern, local experience of the Grassy Narrows First Nation and the historical, sweeping collapse of the Hellenistic Era—the chapter argues that our contemporary meaning crisis, symbolized by the **zombie apocalypse**, represents the ultimate form of domicide, where the very mechanisms for creating meaning have turned against themselves, rendering the world \"unhomeable.\"\n\n---\n\n### Section 4.1: Grassy Narrows\n\nThis section uses the tragic story of the Anishinaabe people of Grassy Narrows to provide a tangible, modern example of domicide.\n\n*   **The Relocation:** In 1963, the Canadian government relocated the Grassy Narrows First Nation to a new reserve with the well-intentioned goal of providing modern amenities like new housing, roads, schools, and electricity.\n\n*   **The Unforeseen Catastrophe:** Despite the material improvements, the community quickly descended into social collapse. By the 1970s, it was plagued by soaring rates of violence, suicide, unemployment, and welfare dependency. While mercury poisoning (Minamata disease) was a severe contributing factor, the Anishinaabe people themselves attribute the beginning of their crisis to the forced relocation, which undermined their cultural resilience to cope with later tragedies.\n\n*   **Housing vs. Homemaking:** The core of the problem is explained through the distinction between *housing* (the physical construction of a shelter) and *homemaking* (the creation of a meaningful place). The government provided housing, but in doing so, they destroyed the Anishinaabe's ability for homemaking.\n    *   On their old reserve, the physical layout was a manifestation of their worldview. They lived in circular compounds separated by clan, with large distances between them. This design reflected their social structure, respected hunting territories, and connected them spiritually to the land, which they believed was filled with a \"force\" or spiritual vitality.\n    *   The circular shape of their dwellings was also significant, referencing the medicine wheel and the four directions, constantly reinforcing their cosmic orientation and sense of wholeness.\n    *   In short, their old home was more than shelter; it was an externalized paradigm of their worldview, telling them who they were, where they belonged, and how to relate to each other and the world.\n\n*   **The Domicide:** The new, suburban-style housing was unintelligible to them. Its layout conveyed nothing of their culture or social order. This \"loss of intelligibility\" created a \"crisis of placement.\" The residents no longer recognized themselves in their environment and could not use their homes to constitute their identity or connect with their world. They were stripped of their sense of place, rendering them homeless in a profound, spiritual sense. This destruction of their worldview-home is what the authors, following Brian Walsh, define as **domicide**.\n\n---\n\n### Section 4.2: Domicide of the Hellenistic Era\n\nThis section scales up the concept of domicide from a local community to an entire civilization to show its universal threat.\n\n*   **The Historical Context:** Following the death of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, his vast empire fractured into warring states. The subsequent centuries of conflict led to massive physical and psychic displacement. People from different cultures, languages, and belief systems were thrown together, and the old political structures (like Athenian democracy) were replaced by distant, monolithic monarchies.\n\n*   **Civilizational Domicide:** This upheaval created a widespread domicide. People lost their connection to a common cultural base, their political agency, and their ability to act intelligibly in a chaotic world. This resulted in a collective estrangement from each other, from the state, and ultimately from themselves.\n\n*   **The Cultural Response:** The Hellenistic world responded to this meaning crisis with a new vision for philosophy. Philosophers like Epicurus framed their work as a form of therapy, with the philosopher acting as a \"physician for the soul\" who could treat human suffering. This was a constructive, healing response to the domicide.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: The Zombie Apocalypse as the Ultimate Domicide\n\nThe chapter concludes by comparing these two case studies to our current cultural moment, as symbolized by the zombie.\n\n*   **A New Kind of Domicide:** The authors argue our modern domicide combines the pervasiveness of the Hellenistic crisis with the self-destructive, internal nature of the Grassy Narrows crisis. While the Hellenistic domicide was caused by external forces (foreign invasion), the Anishinaabe crisis was exacerbated internally—their own cultural framework, placed in the wrong context, amplified the tragedy.\n\n*   **The Zombie as a Symbol:** The zombie perfectly embodies this internal collapse. The zombie apocalypse is a world where culture \"gnaws on itself from within.\" The act of a zombie eating brains symbolizes **intelligibility destroying itself**.\n    *   Unlike the Hellenistic era, which found a symbol of hope and healing in the philosopher-physician, our era's symbol—the zombie—offers no cure. The social order cannot be restored.\n    *   The zombie apocalypse represents the ultimate domicide because the breakdown between the **agent** (the individual) and the **arena** (the world) is total and irreparable. The very tools we would use to rebuild meaning are themselves corrupted, making the world permanently \"unhomeable.\" This elevates our current worldview crisis to a full-blown \"meaning crisis.\"",
      "chapter_text": "4. A Worldview in Crisis:  \nThe Domicide of Apocalypse\n4.1 Grassy Narrows\nWorldview, its creation and its loss, are immeasurably complex \nphenomena to chart and chronicle. Comprehending the scope and \nimplications of a worldview  crisis requires us to deviate from our \ndiscussion of the zombie and return to the work of Brian Walsh in the \nfollowing section . Walsh’s work scaffolds a discussion of worldview \nloss on a term called “domicide ”, a signifier for the destruction of home \nfirst introduced by J. Douglas Porteous and Sandra E. Smit h (2001). In \nour discussions of worldview, we continue to extend the definition of \nhome into a metaphor for the canopy of worldview, the cultural and \ncosmic domiciles that coordinate our beliefs and behavior, like the “faith \nin America” we discussed in section 2 . Two case studies―one local and \nmodern, the other sweeping and historic―will help to carry this term \nup the scale of magnitudes, arguing that “domicide” is the term best \nsuited to a unified symptomatology of our meaning crisis. \nWalsh discusses the Anishinaabe  of the Grassy Narrows  First Nation \nwho live on a reserve in northwestern Ontario, 80 kilometres from \nKenora near the Manitoba border. They were relocated there in 1963 \nby authorities in the Canadian Federal Department of Indian Affairs \nand Northern Development. Motivation for the relocation was well-\nreasoned; access to a variety of provisions―including schools, roads, \nelectricity, health care institutions and employment opportunities―\nwould be considerably improved. Most significantly, the housing that \n© 2017 J. Vervaeke, C. Mastropietro, F.

They had more power and more protection against the \nelements. In a very short period of time, Grassy Narrows was spared \nfrom the modest conditions of their old reserve and inaugurated into \nthe life of contemporary suburban domesticity.\nWhat followed was an effect that very few individuals―and \napparently no one within the Federal Department―managed to foresee. \nBy 1970, the Grassy Narrows  Nation was “the site of some of the most \nsevere social and familial disintegration, together with environmental \ndespoliation, ever to be seen in North Amer ica” (Wals h 2006). Cases of \ndomestic conflict, violence and suicide  exploded in number, employment \nplummeted, welfare dependency increased and as many 1000 people \nshowed symptoms of being infected with Minamata disease, caused \nby mercury-dumping upstream. “By the mid-80’s, the Grassy Narrows \ncommunity demonstrated the numbness of spirit and utter hopelessness \nthat rivaled any Third World situa tion” (Wal sh 2006).1\nA great deal of public fallout came with the exposure of these \nconditions. Criticisms in both popular media and academic \npublications―Walsh’s included―took the disaster of Grassy Narrows  \nas an opportunity to charge the Federal Department with “cultural \ngenocide”, an accusation that interrogated the issue through post-\ncolonial critique. Walsh noticed, however, that the deepest and most \ncompelling aspect of the crisis was the cultural upset that occurred \nwithin the walls of the community. The transition into new housing \ndid not have the reasonable effect that the officials in question were \nhoping for; even if we assume the Federal Department acted on benign \n1        We follow Walsh in acknowledging that the appearance of Minamata disease from the \nmercury poisoning in the English-Wabagoon River contributed severely to the Grassy \nNarrows ’ devastation from the sixties to present day. However, Walsh also notes that \nthe Anishinaabe  attribute the beginnings of this crisis to their forced relocation, which \nby their accounts preceded the appearance of Minamata symptoms. It seems likely \nthat the loss of home exacerbated the ecological devastation caused by the toxicity, \nundermining the social and cultural resourcefulness that would have equipped the \ncommunity to respond. “ As one member of the community put it, ‘Now we have \nnothing. Not the old, not the new. Our families are all broken up. We are caught in \nthe middle […] between two worlds, two ways of life’”  (Walsh 20 06). If the dynamics \nof worldview  sustain the coherence of family and community, the collapse of these \ndynamics likely precipitated the loss of those support systems; a community cannot \nturn to its world for help if it is lost between one world and another. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

A Worldview in Crisis\nintentions, it was arguably their relocation of the reserve that exacerbated \nthe disintegration of the Grassy Narrows Nation. \nWhy did this happen? Answering this question requires us to \nidentify with a very severe kind of deprivation that occurred in the \nNation’s relocation. Walsh’s discussion of this deprivation begins \nby describing a complex relationship between two interconnected \nsociocultural practices that, in 1963, were suddenly at loggerheads. This \nis the relationship between housing  and  homemaking . Understanding the \ndepth of distinction in this relationship is crucial to unpacking the fate \nof Grassy Narrows . What precisely do we mean by home? \nFirst, consider the role of homemaking  conterminous to house \nmaking . The house maker tends to the physical construction of a space \nand materializes the optimal arrangement for its organization―\nan arrangement that precedes and afterward consummates the \nconstruction. The house is built in agreement with a design that affords \nthis arrangement. The homemaker is ultimately responsible for it. He is \nthe one who organizes the space long before the house maker is enlisted \nto raise it, and makes it meaningful  long after the house maker has gone \nhome. The relationship is effectively described by a quote  that Walsh \n(2006) cites early in his article: “We shape our buildings”, Winston \nChurchill  wrote. “Then our buildings shape us”. \nNow consider the testimony of a 71 year-old Grassy Narrows  elder, \nafter his community began to disintegrate:\nWe don’t live like the white man, that’s not our way. The white man \nlives close together, but we don’t. We like to live far apart, in families. On \nthe old reserve, you knew your place. Everybody respected your place. \n[…] It wasn’t private property, but it was a sense of place, your place, \nyour force around you. […] As soon as they started to bunch us up, the \nproblems started, the drinking, the violence. This has a lot to do with \nbein g bunched up. (Walsh 2006)\nOn the old reserve, the Anishinaabe  lived in a series of circular compounds \nthat were separated by clan. These compounds had been placed at a great \ndistance from one another, and had equal access to the river. This distance \nrespected the territoriality of hunting and trapping, but also helped to \nmark a configuration in the plot of the reserve that reflected the social \nstructure and hierarchical organization of the community. Not only did \nthe spaciousness of the reserve support and enable the hunter-gathering \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n38 \nZombies in Western Culture\ncustoms, but it also served as an implicit reminder of one’s position in the \nreserve relative to his neighbors, and what that relationship permitted \nin terms of the cultural praxis. A clan’s presence within the reserve was \ndetermined by the placement of their compound, in which the status \nof their membership within the culture was encoded. The particular \nemplotment of a family’s home had significance; it gave both identity \nand security and told each clan where it was meant to be. It observed \nthe sense of place described by the elder. That sense did not only connect \none clan to another, but connected the reserve as a whole with the living \nland it inhabited. The Anishinaabe belief in “force” invokes the fluency \nof worldview  attunement  that we have discussed; there is the force of \nforegrounding and the configuration of place out of physical space. The \nelder refers to an energy that inhabits all space in accordance with a Great \nSpirit; even the space we assume dead or empty is filled with a spiritual \nquality that gives the space its vitality. Affording the place for this \nforce was therefore a matter of necessity, tantamount to the importance \nof accessing water, game and arable soil. It was also believed that, not \nunlike natural provisions, certain places were more inherently charged \nwith this force than others. Naturally then, the degree to which empty \nspace could be cultivated within the confines of the reserve determined \nthe suitableness of the reserve for habitation, and the empowerment \nof its residents to maintain both physical and spiritual health. It is also \nimportant to note that the circular structures of the compounds were \ndeliberate patterns created in likeness of the “medicine wheel and the \ndrum, and representing the four directions […] integral to a sense of well-\nbeing, wholeness an d being at  home” (Walsh 2006). The circle of the home \ncontinuously impressed these directions into the cognitive landscape of \nsignificance, tracking relevant movements, delineating whereabouts and \nfixing the individual’s position relative to the dimensions of the world \naround him. The old reserve of the Anishinaabe provided more than \nshelter. It provided a worldview ,\na vision of life that provides its adherents with a foundational \nunderstanding of how the world works. That means, however, that \na worldview  necessarily also functions as a vision for life that gives \ndirection for normative and life-giving ways to live. A worldview shapes \nthose who live in its embrace so that they develop certain habits […] \nways of living and relating to each ot her in the  world. (Walsh 2006)\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 39\n4. A Worldview in Crisis\nThe Anishinaabe ’s home was not significant simply by its place in the \noutside plot, but just as deeply by the interior shape of the dwelling . It is \nthe signifying of space that makes a place  of it. Place emerges not simply \nin us, or simply in space, but in the mutual modeling that prepares one \nfor contact with the other. Place is the way of encountering, occupying \nand appropriating space, the finding of relevance within  space, and the \npresence of ourselves as part of the space. We have evidence for this \nanywhere we build. We build spaces that anticipate our involvement \nin them, and become externalized paradigms of relevance. “Buildings \nbehave, demonstrate c ertain leg ibility” (Walsh 2006). \nThe residents of Grassy Narrows  weren’t homeowners anymore \nbecause the moment the housing project was completed, they had \nceased to be homemakers. They weren’t recognizing  themselves within \ntheir homes, and they weren’t connecting  to anyone through their homes. \nAt home, you are more than simply an occupant; home remembers you, \nhome understands you, home is where you are recognized, home is \nwhere you belong. But recall the comments made by the elder of Grassy \nNarrows: the space no longer communicated to its occupants. It wasn’t \nconveying any more. It was not telling. It was not remembering, and it \nwas not understanding. The arrangement failed because the space was \nno longer phrased in any perceivable order. It could no longer answer \nimplicit questions of who, what, where or why. The loss of intelligibility \nto the organization induced a crisis of placement. The residents no \nlonger understood the affordances  of their environment. They were no \nlonger able to use their homes as a way to constitute themselves. They \ncould no longer use them to be part of the world. \n“Strip a people of that sense of place, deprive them of the space that \nthey feel is necessary to establish such a sense of place, and they ar e \nrendered  homeless” (Walsh 2006). Following Walsh’s definition, the loss \nof home may be called domicide . \nHumans are animals who most fundamentally understand what reality \nis, who we are, and how we ought to live by locating ourselves within \nlarger narratives and metanarratives that we hear and tell, and that \nconstitute for us what is real and significant. When such narratives \ncollapse, we are lost in the dislocation, fragmentation and disorientation \nof homelessness . […] In short, one suffers from a worldview  crisis. One \nruns the ris k of “losi ng the plot”. (Walsh 2006)\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017.

Instead of fitting together, the agent and the \narena are irreparably out of joint. Consequently, the world of the zombie \napocalypse is a diseased world in  perpetua l decay. As Wood (2003: 105) \nargues, “the social order […] can’t be restored”.\n4.2 Domicide of the Hellenistic  Era\nFig. 7: Bronze bust of a man,  ca.

A Worldview in Crisis\nAcross epochs in history, and from individual communities like that of \nGrassy Narrows  to entire civilizations, social order and culture appear to \nbe universally vulnerable to the threat of domicide . Just as an ecosystem \ncan be irreparably disrupted at any time, whether constituted by the \ndust mites in your pillowcase or the creatures of the Cretaceous, so too \ncan the virtual ecology of worldview  attunement  unravel. That a culture \nis living means that, inevitably, it will die. \nFor instance, the Hellenistic  period from the fourth-first century BCE \nwas marked by unprecedented conflict and strife, procuring widespread \nsocial and political unrest. Alexander the Great  had conquered most of \nthe known world, and just as he was to begin his rule, he unexpectedly \nfell ill and died in Babylon, bestowing a tenor of senseless tragedy on an \nera that would incur further tragedy still. His great kingdom split into \nfour states which subsequently went to war for the next several centuries. \nThis period of upheaval left people massively displaced both physically \nand psychically. It became commonplace to be surrounded by others \nwho did not share the same language, nor heritage, nor values. Athens \nhad once been the seat of democracy, with every man encouraged to \nparticipate in its political and economic affairs; now, one would have \nbeen thousands of kilometers away from an unmovable, monolithic \nmonarchy. As with the Anishinaabe , the collapse of a common social \nand cultural base estranged people from one another. By losing their \npolitical and economic agency, a chasm formed between people and \nstate. By virtue of losing their connection with and being unable to act \nintelligibly in their world, people became estranged to themselves.\nThe suffocating domicide  of the Hellenistic  Era  is reflected in the \nemergence of the symbol  of the philosopher as physician. As Epicurus  \nfamously remarked,\nEmpty is that philosopher’s argument by which no human suffering \nis therapeutically treated. For just as there is no use in a medical art \nthat does not cast out the sicknesses of bodies, so too there is no use in \nphilosophy, unless  it casts out  the suffering of the soul. (Nussbaum 1994)\nHellenic philosophy centrally came to emphasize self-healing, in stark \ncontrast to our zombie, afflicted by a disease with no cure.\nThere is something telling in the comparative semiosis of our \npresent-day zombie and the Hellenic philosopher-physician. In the \nHellenistic  domicide , individual and collective agency was usurped \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n42 \nZombies in Western Culture\nby the widespread intrusion of foreigners and foreign rule. With the \nAnishinaabe  however, after the initial blow of relocation, the foreignness \nthat encroached came from within. Their worldview  attunement  worked \nagainst itself, alienating individuals from themselves, from others, and \ntheir cultural metanarratives. It was precisely because of the way their \nculture was structured that it fell apart under those circumstances, \nrather than offering salvation and deliverance from those circumstances. \nCulture amplified, rather than ameliorated, tragedy. It gnaw ed on itself \nfrom within.3\nRecall from section 3.1  that the zombie eats brains―that brain is eating \nbrain, the instrument of intelligibility. The instrument poses a threat to \nitself (see also Vervaeke and Ferraro 2013,  vis-à-vis  parasitic processing). \nThe zombie embodies this hidden vulnerability twofold―it is not only \nparasitic on our intelligibility, but in its heedlessness  it is also parasitic \nunto itself. It is one thing for culture to run its course and give rise to \nthe next stage in its development, or even to be conquered by another \nculture―a death and rebirth, if you will. It is another for it to trip over \nitself and expedite its own demise―a wa king  death the walking dead \nepitomize. As Hume  (1889) wrote, “the corruption of the best things \ngives rise to the worst”. Our domicide  is more like the Anishinaabes’ in \nthis sense, but as penetrating and pervasive as the Hellenes ’. Therein lies \nthe rub of the pairing of zombie and apocalypse . Nature will overgrow \nand smooth the jagged edges of cataclysm. Even the vampire  or alien  \nwill seek to re-establish their systems and way of life. The zombie is \nthe creature most unfit to reverse the status of apocalypse. The agency-\narena breakdown is so complete, so thorough, that our very apparatuses \nfor restoring order are themselves rendered irreparable. It is these two \nfactors that concomitantly elevate the domicide we are experiencing to a \nfull-blown meaning crisis. Unlike the Hellenes who found comfort from \ntheir cultural domicide in the symbol  of the sage―the philosopher-\nphysician who could alleviate suffering―our symbol of the zombie \napocalypse offers only the grim prognosis that, like a cancer, our culture \nis doomed to destroy itself from within.\n3        The point not being a critique of Anishinaabe  culture, but a demonstration that \nunder certain circumstances, any culture can eat itself from within.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

      "long_summary": "This is a detailed summary of Chapter 5, \"The Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse: Converging Evidence for a Crisis in Meaning,\" from the book *Zombies in Western Culture*.\n\n### **Overall Thesis**\n\nThe chapter argues that the zombie apocalypse archetype in popular culture is a powerful symbol for a profound and widespread \"crisis in meaning\" in contemporary Western society. The authors propose that this crisis is not a single issue but a convergence of several interconnected and mutually reinforcing problems. To structure their evidence, they employ the metaphor of the Four Horsemen of the Christian Apocalypse—Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War—repurposing them to represent the key symptoms of this modern spiritual and cultural decline.\n\n### **The Four Horsemen Framework**\n\nThe authors introduce their rhetorical framework by mapping the traditional Four Horsemen to specific aspects of the meaning crisis:\n\n*   **Death:** Represents the death of the overarching religious worldview (specifically, the Judeo-Christian \"sacred canopy\") that once provided a meta-meaning system for Western culture.\n*   **Famine:** Represents a spiritual and psychological hunger for meaning, manifesting as hopelessness and a rising tide of suicide.\n*   **Pestilence:** Represents the plague of social isolation and loneliness, spreading through society and weakening interpersonal relationships.\n*   **War:** Represents the disillusionment with, and disengagement from, cornerstone cultural institutions, particularly the political state.\n\n### **1. Death: The Collapse of the Sacred Canopy**\n\nThis section argues that the foundational crisis is the decline of organized religion as a unifying force.\n\n*   **The Death of Faith:** The authors posit that the zombie apocalypse in fiction symbolizes the death of the Christian meta-meaning system that once integrated all aspects of Western life (politics, family, law). Zombie films, particularly those by George A. Romero, often portray religion as ineffective in the face of the apocalypse.\n*   **The Rise of the \"Nones\":** The primary evidence for this collapse is the dramatic increase in the \"religiously unaffiliated,\" or \"nones,\" especially among younger generations. This is not necessarily a rejection of spirituality itself but a deep-seated disillusionment with organized religion, which is seen as isolating and irrelevant.\n*   **Ersatz Mythologies (Pseudo-Religions):** In the vacuum left by traditional religion, \"pseudo-religions\" have emerged from popular culture. The authors point to the massive popularity of superhero narratives (like the Marvel Cinematic Universe) and other fictional mythologies (like Star Wars). These systems mimic religious structures—with archetypal heroes, moral codes, and communal rituals (cosplay, conventions)—but they lack genuine *existential import*. One can live as a Christian, but one cannot truly live as an Avenger; these myths \"satisfice without satisfying.\"\n*   **Centrality of Death:** This \"horseman\" is the central rhythm of the crisis. The loss of a unifying worldview is the core \"domicide\" (loss of a cultural home) that gives rise to the other symptoms.\n\n### **2. Famine: A Hunger for Meaning and the Rise of Suicide**\n\nThis section links the meaning crisis to the individual's inner world, focusing on the alarming rise in suicide.\n\n*   **Suicide as Radical Disengagement:** The chapter presents stark statistics on the global and national increase in suicide rates, framing it as the ultimate expression of hopelessness and the most literal form of disengagement from a world perceived as meaningless.\n*   **Social Roots of Suicide:** Drawing on the work of Émile Durkheim and Viktor Frankl, the authors argue that suicide is not merely an individual psychological issue but is deeply tied to the loss of one's place within a social and cultural order. It is a \"famine\" of meaning, where the individual is starved of reasons to live.\n*   **Contributing Factors:**\n    *   **Economic Instability:** Economic crashes (like 2008) correlate with spikes in suicide, not just due to poverty, but because of a lost sense of *economic agency* and faith in the systems that are supposed to provide stability.\n    *   **Political and Social Breakdown:** Political volatility and the decline in marriage and religious affiliation are also linked to higher suicide rates. The \"nones\" exhibit higher rates of suicide, demonstrating a comprehensive loss of the social institutions that traditionally provided meaning and protection.\n*   **The Zombie as \"Suicide Aborted\":** The authors conclude this section by framing the zombie as a creature in which the \"hunger for a way out\" has not ended in death but has mutated into a mindless, insatiable craving for the very sapience (brains) it has lost.\n\n### **3. Pestilence: The Plague of Social Disconnection**\n\nThis section explores the breakdown of interpersonal relationships as a symptom of the meaning crisis.\n\n*   **Rising Social Isolation:** Evidence from the General Social Survey shows a dramatic increase in the number of people who report having no one to confide in. Our social networks are shrinking and becoming less intimate.\n*   **Technology's Role:** While technology allows for more connections, the authors argue that the massive increase in time spent online has not resulted in a proportional increase in meaningful relationships. People are \"plugging in\" precisely because they feel disconnected.\n*   **The Decline of Marriage:** The institution of marriage is also failing. Divorce rates are up, marriage rates are down, and the rise of prenuptial agreements suggests a deep-seated mistrust. This is paradoxical, as people still overwhelmingly cite family as the most important thing in their lives, indicating a desire for the connection that the institution no longer reliably provides.\n*   **A Self-Reinforcing Catastrophe:** The chapter connects the horsemen, showing how social isolation (Pestilence) contributes to suicide (Famine), which is exacerbated by the decline of religious and marital institutions (Death).\n\n### **4. War: Disengagement from the State and the Rise of \"Bullshit\"**\n\nThis section focuses on the breakdown of the relationship between the individual and the state, and the resulting pollution of public discourse.\n\n*   **Political Apathy:** Evidence includes declining voter turnout across the democratic world, signaling a loss of faith in political institutions and a feeling of powerlessness (a loss of *political agency*).\n*   **The Paradox of Politicization:** Simultaneously, while formal political participation wanes, society has become increasingly politicized around identity groups (race, gender, class). These identities have become \"pseudo-religious domiciles\"—inadequate shelters against the broader meaning crisis.\n*   **The Failure of Politics as Religion:** The authors argue that the 20th century's disastrous experiments with totalitarian ideologies (Nazism, Marxism) proved that politics is not just an insufficient but a dangerous replacement for a genuine meta-meaning system. The result has been widespread **cynicism**.\n*   **The Concept of \"Bullshit\":** The chapter dedicates significant analysis to Harry Frankfurt's concept of \"bullshit.\"\n    *   **Definition:** Bullshit is distinct from lying. A liar cares about the truth in order to subvert it. A bullshitter has no concern for the truth whatsoever; they are only concerned with **salience and appearance**.\n    *   **Impact:** A culture saturated with bullshit poisons the relationship between individuals and institutions. It creates a self-deceptive environment that leads to two corrosive outcomes: **heedless fundamentalism** (believing anything that is salient) and **vigorous cynicism** (rejecting the possibility of truth altogether).\n    *   **Modern Examples:** The rise of satirical news and the success of anti-establishment political figures (like Trump and Sanders) are presented as evidence of a culture reacting to, and participating in, this environment of bullshit.\n\nIn conclusion, the chapter presents a grim but holistic diagnosis of a Western culture adrift. The converging crises of religious decline, personal despair, social atomization, and political cynicism are not separate phenomena but interwoven symptoms of a single, underlying **meaning crisis**, vividly and horrifically symbolized by the figure of the zombie.",

It would be \nimpossible to shed light on an indeterminate condition without venturing \ninto territories where no present research exists. The evidence of crisis \nis sprawled across a spectrum of phenomena. To survey such a vast \ncoastline, a degree of disciplinary eclecticism is required. This does not \nmean that our theory of the crisis is eclectic, but that to properly triage \nthe condition, our account of signs and symptoms must vary according to \nthe kinds of expertise required to investigate them. This suggests that an \nintegrative, holistic approach is essential. Such is the only justification for \nan essay on human meaning via an exegesis on zombie lore.\nHowever, we now have a plausible hermeneutic of the semiosis of \nthe zombie as a symbol  of the meaning crisis. It is now time to consider \nthe empirical evidence for the existence of the crisis. While it may be \npossible to give a partial account for each of the individual phenomena \nwe investigate without invoking the zombie, no such explanation can \ndispel the mystery of how, and why, these seemingly disparate crises are \ndeveloping simultaneously and in a mutually reinforcing manner. There \nis, as Charles Taylo r (199 1: 3) notes in The Malaise of Modernity , “a certain \nconvergence on themes of decline. They are often variations around a few \ncentral melodies”. Although our base is holistic, we shall demonstrate a \nconvergence of evidence for a crisis in meaning. Respecting the zombie \napocalypse  as the flag-bearing symbol for the meaning crisis, we propose \nto rhetorically organize the evidence for the crisis into categories analogous \nto the iconic symbol of the Christian  apocalypse, viz., the four horsemen. \n“Through distinctly Christian symbolism, the zombie can be seen to \nrepresent a subversive rejection of an enforced Catholi cism” (Moreman \n2010:  264-65). The four horsemen  of the Christian Apocalypse―Famine , \nPestilence , War and Death―carry the themes of decay and self-subversion \nsuited to scaffold our zombie apocalypse. \nIf the zombie draws out our withdrawal, stands for our lack of standing \nfor anything, and is in touch with how out of touch our worldview  has \nbecome, then the zombie is the embodiment of domicide . Its lack of \nreflection is revealed in a disturbing trend of radical disengagement \ncutting across all domains of human life, deeply severing ties to \nourselves, others, and an overarching social metanarrative . We stand \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 45\n5. The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nto lose our cognizance, communicability, community and culture. We \nstand to become the walking dead. This is our zombie apocalypse .\nWe hunger for meaning in the normative void of a collapsing \nworldview , starving of an empty mind, facing Famine  in a culture of \nexcess. Loneliness spreads, quite literally,  like a disease (Cacioppo, \nFowler, an d Christakis 2009), poisoning and thinning our relationships \nlike Pestilence . At the same time, we are deeply disillusioned by \ncornerstone cultural institutions such as politics, marriage , religion \nand media―casualties of a War  with (and within) the state. Death, the \nspectre of domicide , disengagement from our worldview, is at once the \nmeans and end, the alpha and omega of the meaning crisis that animates \nthe horror of the zombie apocalypse .\n5.1 Death\nIn chapter 3, we discussed the gradual formation of the zombie symbol  \nthrough a sequence of films leading up to the present day. These films \nmoulded the features of the zombie, developing the apocalypse  more \nand more explicitly. However, perhaps the most significant property \nof the zombie apocalypse is the relationship it has with religion. If \nour culture’s worldview  was successfully maintained by the meta-\nmeaningfulness of the Christian  faith, the zombie apocalypse represents \nthe death of this worldview, and the death of faith itself. Michael Walzer  \nmakes the following observations in reference to Romero’s films, which, \nas discussed above, are the prototypical exemplars for the phenomenon: \n[Zombie] films at face value appeal to a faithless world-view. […] Many \ncritics have recognized the racial, feminist, anti-capitalist, anti-war, and \ngenerally anti-authoritarian stances in Romero’s films. Few, if any, have paid \nmuch heed to the religious implications, however. When religion appears in \nthese films, it is generally  shown to be inef fective. (Moreman 2010: 272)\nReligion is the most universal instance of worldview  attunement  to \npreside in the history of our species.2 It is, like our individual homes, “a \ndense moral culture within which [people] fe el some sen se of belonging” \n(Walzer 1987).\n2        We are not being religiously apologetic or hearkening for a return to Christian  \nsymbolism; we have no adherence to its content, merely pointing out its historical \nfunctionality.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

Indeed, \nPeter Berger, would say that sharing a worldview  provides a community \nwith a “sacred canopy ”, a mythic cover of protection for life, under \nwhich the day-to-day business of making homes, shaping community \nand sustain ing life t ogether can happen. (Walsh 2006)\nConsider the role of religion prior to the scientific revolution. In the West, \nthe Roman Catholic  Church was not separated from the dealings of other \nsocietal systems; its creeds and councils governed all of the systems \nthat facilitated significant practices in society―political, economic, \njudicial, marital, recreational, etc. Everything was understood under \nthe governance of the church , and it was by virtue of this overarching \ngovernance that everything came together. That is why Geertz  defined \nreligion as a meta-meaning  system, a form of worldview  attunement  \nthat integrates cultural relevance in all of its forms, and places all other \nmeaning systems into an order of coherence and stability. Then came \nthe separation: “church and state”. A reflection of diminishment in the \nintegrative power of the system. Broadly speaking, we in the West do \nnot gather as a society around our churches any more. We do not rally \nto them for restitution. When fortuitous events occur, we do not tribute \nthem. When terrifying events occur, we do not round on them.\nIn the West, we are realizing with divisive discomfort that our \nJudeo-Christian  model of meaning, which occupied our teleological \nawareness for over a millennium, was unprepared for the post-scientific \nworld into which it was ushered. In our contemporary division of the \nsciences, burgeoning naturalistic accounts supported by a dawning \ncomprehension of the brain, much of our scriptural teleology no longer \nsatisfies us to our core, and our previously personified, cooperative \nuniverse can no longer be trusted to hold us in its favour. At no one \nmoment in particular, we as a civilization lost the anchorage by which \nwe could govern and organize a sense of the Absolute.3 It is an ill-\nkept secret that the institutions of older worlds are increasingly held \nin contempt, left to witness the dissenting of their congregations. In \ngeneral, attendances in churches worldwide are failing despite the \n3        In the philosophical tradition, the Absolute is a concept of ultimate reality, truth or \nessence whose existence is eternal and unconditional.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nstrained attempts of religious bel lwethers to reaffirm thei r relevance \n(Norris and Inglehart 2015).\nResearch for the trend is piling up. According to a study by the Pew \nResearch Center , nearly a quarter of the US public4 and “a third of adults \nunder 30―are ‘religiously unaffiliated’―the highest percentages ever in \nPew Research Center polling”5 history, overtaking Catholics, mainline \nProtestants , and all followers of non-Christian  faiths. This percentage has \nrisen steeply just in the last few years, and the demographic data is telling: \nmany of the unaffiliated in the study are identified as young adults who, \nunlike prior generations, are characterizing their lack of attendance in \nreligious services as a form of disengagement reflective of their disregard. \nIn other words, fewer people are inclined to say “I am Catholic ” if they \ndon’t regularly attend a Catholic service. Instead of simply identifying \nwith religion on a de facto  basis (as with citizenship or ethnicity) more \npeople are actively refusing the identification in cases where it is obviously \ninapplicable. This unclassifiable group has come to be called the religious \n“nones” . In roughly half of the world’s countries, they are the second-\nlargest religious group.6 According to the Pew Research Center , they \nmark the symptoms of an increasingly widespread disaffiliation from \ninstitutional religious participation. However, the religiously unaffiliated \nhave not necessarily rejected a spiritual life. In fact, many cite the desire \nfor a genuine spiritual life as related to their disinclination to organized \nreligion. In other words, the refusal to invest in specific organized religions \ndoes not indicate irreligiousness. 58% of the “nones”  report feeling a deep \nconnection with the earth or nature. This finding is no different than the \npercentage for the general US population. Many research participants \nexpressed the following sentiments: that though religion in general does \nin fact benefit society, the religions themselves are just too isolating and \nunsatisfying in content and in practice. In 2016, only 55% of millennials \ncredited religious organizations with “having a positive impact on the \nway things were going in the country”, compared with 73% six years \nearlier, demonstrating the increasing irrelevance and, in fact, disdain for \n4        http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/  \n5        http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise/  \n6        http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/22/what-is-each-countrys-second  \n-largest-religious-group/  \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

What is clear, however, is that \nthe spiritual vacuum is not moving people towards organized religion; it \nis (at least in part) causing their dissent.\nIn the culture of criticism, “nones”  of analysis have now emerged \nin response to the vacuum. Many of them assemble loosely under the \ntitle of postmodernism , taking an approach to theory that subverts \nconventional formulations of structure, and subjects human activity to \nillimitable interpretability. Postmodernism reacts to the precariousness \nof social identity, the dilemmas of relativism, the problems of agency \nand the denaturalizing of mind, message, power, language and the \nanthropocentric world. It wonders how the individual hopes to navigate \nan unnavigable sea of possible meanings and whether there can ever be \nan essentiality to the living of life, a definitive indication of who and \nwhere  we are and what we ought to be. It wonders because the answers \naren’t clear anymore, because modernity feels the absence of a singular \ngoverning system for our beliefs. It is as though we are struck suddenly \nwith the realization that no one is watching us. There is no skyhook of \nappraisal for our performance. There is no superintendent to approve or \ndisapprove of our actions. We have awoken to the task of being our own \nminders, responding to our own directives, drawing our own maps and \nwriting our own rules. We are adolescents reeling from the prospect \nof our independence, disarranged from the sudden loss of a parental \nsource. And now, it sometimes seems that anything goes. The world no \nlonger offers itself as an attendant. All responsibility we put upon the \nonce fated world now rests entirely upon our shoulders.\nEvidence that our cultural institutions are failing us can be found \nin the worldwide rise of the religiously unaffiliated―these so-called \n“nones” . Yet their disillusionment does not inoculate the “nones”  from \nthe corresponding losses of religion. They still crave a sense of home, \na presence in community, and a system of shared beliefs. The lapse \nof the “nones”  from religious participation, though different in many \nrespects from the domicide  of the Anishinaabe , poses a similar, if more \ngradual, declension in worldview attunement . Since this attunement is \n7        http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/04/millennials-views-of-news-\nmedia -religious-organizations-grow-more-negative/  \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nfundamental to the agent-arena  relation discussed above, the loss has \na calcifying effect on its ecology, and on all meaningful  participation \nthat was inculcated by the coverage of a sacred canopy . As Walsh and \nothers have observed, this canopy does not simply project doctrinal \nand creedal beliefs, but every element of religious activity that has \npsychological importance; the social, communal and ritual dynamics \nof participating in the world beyond oneself. These dynamics are like \na respiratory system for the ecology of attunement, providing fluidity \nto the economy of the agent-arena relation and its mutual affordances  \nfor action. In the absence of this fluidity, the ecology of the religious \nworldview is not sustainable. The respiratory system, without the \naccord of its component chambers, cannot function properly. \nFor the “unaffiliated” portion of our population, respiration of \nworldview  attunement  is no longer performed by organized religious \ninfluence. If the worldview of Christianity  is eclipsed by secularization, \nthen there is no viable way to recapture its potency as a meta-meaning  \nsystem. This means that we need to find alternative systems of meaning \nthat provide similar combinations of symbolic provocation, ritual and \nsocial fluency. As it turns out, such systems are not easily recreated. \nYou cannot breathe deeply, after all, without an adequate respiratory \napparatus. Out from under the canopy, our culture is left gasping in a \nmiasma; finding our bearings in the world, establishing our capacity \nfor action, understanding what is expected of us―these are all \nSisyphean tasks while the different arenas of life remain farraginous \nand uncoordinated to the eyes of the agents who navigate them. \nEvidence of our gasping has surfaced widely across contemporary \npopular culture. Ersatz mythologies have emerged as a kind of \nsimilitude for the collapsed lung of religious institutions, presenting \nwould-be symbols of vitality obverse to the decay represented by the \nzombie. “ A panoply of new re ligions formed in  the wake of the [sacred] \ncanopy’s rending” (Moreman 2010: 273). Like the zombie itself, these \nmythologies have their origins in narrative fiction, with properties that \nhave, in some cases, generated mass following and elevated them to \nthe status of zeitgeist. Though they differ by source, certain elements of \nthese fictions are concentric with the structures of the Christian  mythos, \nand draw their significance―consciously or not―from the echo of .\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

However, though the mythologies have \nparticipatory elements, none have espoused the complexity of belief that \nintegrates their narrative into a fully-fledged, dynamical worldview .9 \nEven while participating in these mythologies, the identification of the \nparticipants is limited, and their disbelief, while suspended, remains \nintact. Where a person mistakes a pseudo-mythology for a genuine \nreligious worldview and identifies with its narrative beyond a plausible \nlimit, his belief is regarded as infantile or delusional. At best, he is \nthought to be unsociable. At worst, he is considered cultish.\nFig. 9: San Diego Comic Con  (2012). Photo by Kevin Dooley.10\n8        The authors are astonished that many seem offended by the suggestion that these \nErsatz mythologies are anything but secular and identify this as a ‘masked man’ \nfallacy. It would be largely uncontroversial for a cultural anthropologist to describe \nthese activities as religious. We conjecture that these activities reflect a desire for \nreligion, but the offense at naming them as such reflects a pervasive sense of the \nobsolescence, impotence and even damage attributed to organized religion. That \nthese powerful Christian  narratives and archetypes are exapted again and again \nthrough these Ersatz mythologies, however, validates some of their power and \nexistential import.\n9        Our replacement functionalities have been insufficient. They are derivative of \nsystems—particularly Christianity—that have already been eclipsed. They do not \noffer something new. More than being merely derivative, however, they satisfice \nwithout satisfying, preventing the necessary transformations for addressing our \nmeaning crisis.

To date, there have been over 200 \nsuperhero films made by major studios in the United States, grossing \nover 15 billion dollars12 worldwide and supplemented with copious \nmerchandising. As the frequency of these films has increased, an \ninteresting phenomenon has begun to occur; the studios responsible \nfor these creative properties are making more deliberate attempts \nto establish metanarrative  across the spectrum of their works. They \nhave rolled out shared universes for their characters, with longer arcs \nand more integrated storylines. These are all efforts to situate the \nvarious films in a way that makes them gesture across time, makes \nthem more relevant to one another, and by extension, makes them \nmore intrinsically relevant to themselves.

Though the identification is―in the most literal \nterms―only in pretend, the playfulness and sense of community are \nmanifest. Most significantly, these mythos feature figures that, like \nthe prototypical Superman and the monkish Jedi , have unmistakable \nresemblances to Christ , Buddha  and other divinities. The pseudo-\nreligious mythologies have impressionistically co-opted this \nresemblance for maximum cultural impact. Even when the likeness is \nuncanny, the appeal of these mythologies is unshaken.\nThe internet and social media have provided new playgrounds \nthrough which to shape our involvement in these pseudo-religions , \nallowing people to come together under various memberships and \naffiliations. This is religion without existential import―its wisdom \nis only as good as the universe it comes from. The reasons for this \nare complex, and beyond the scope of this book. Sufficed to say, it \nis uncontroversial to presume that one may live as a Christian  or a \nMuslim, but not as an Avenger , Jedi  or Brony .13 Despite secular \narguments that invoke fairy tales to argue that religious narratives \nare quixotic fantasies, most sense implicitly that these comparisons \nare wanting. The Marvel Cinematic Universe does not have equal \nimport to a religious meta-meaning  system, and one cannot simply \nsubstitute one for the other. It seems plausible however, that the rise \nof the former, coinciding with the decline of the latter, may be trying \nto make up some portion of the difference. \nThe pale horseman of Death rides at the axis of the meaning crisis, \nand the other horsemen on his flank―Famine , Pestilence  and War ―\nare variations on a sweeping cultural dissolution at the scales of \nindividual phenomenology, distributed over social experience, and \nmanifest writ large in the treatment of political life and institutions. \nIn all cases, the phenomena, to the scales of each of these levels of \n13        We discuss this further in section 5.2.3  below, “Suicide, Marital Status and Religious \nAffiliation”.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

It is important to \nreiterate that while each of these individual scales―we might think \nof them as sections of an orchestra―play a dirgeful rendition of \n“melodies of decline”, Death provides the central rhythm. The \nWestern decline of religion, concomitant with imitating mythologies \nand the growing demographic of “nones” , are co-emergent with the \nzombie symbol  of apocalypse . The many properties that constitute \nthe Deathliness of the zombie―its mindlessness , homelessness , \nspeechlessness, ugliness and heedlessness ―are merely analogues \nfor symptoms of domicide  that have emerged along the dimensions \nof our personal, social and civic existence. Our horsemen are \nmythograms for these symptoms.\n5.2 Famine\nThere is perhaps no greater evidence for radical disengagement from \nthe world than the rising crimson tide of suicide  worldwide. In the \nUS, suicide rates have increased in all age groups si nce 1999 except \nthos e 75+, with suicide rates tripling in  the 35-64 demographic as of \n2010 (Sullivan et al.  2013; Curtin, Warner, and Hedegaard 2016a). Now, \nsuicide accounts for more deaths each year in the US than by motor \nvehicle accidents, and is the second leading cause of death of those \naged 10-34.14\nAnd this isn’t exclusively a North American phenomenon. According \nto the World Health Organization, suicide  rates have increased 60% \nworldwide over the past 45 years. Worse still, the Center for Disease \nControl estimates that for every suicide, there are 25 suicide attempts. \nAssuming this ratio has held constant over the past 45 years, a 60% \nincrease in suicide would suggest a 1500% increase in suicide attempts \nworldwide. The number one cause of suicide is reportedly untreated \n14        Note that the increase in suicide  is not simply accounted for by an increase in \npopulation or in longevity. Suicide rates reported here, unless otherwise noted, \nare corrected to population size (reported as per 100,000). Life expectancy in the \nUS in 2010 was 78.7, up from 76.7 in 1999, not likely to dramatically skew the age \ndistribution of suicide.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

Though we in the West tend \nto view suicide  as a highly individual phenomenon, some of the \nearliest  res earch on suicide, such as the extensive study on the \nsubject conducted by Émile Durkheim  (1897), cogently illustrates the \ndeeply social nature of suicide and its intimate ties with a person’s \nsense of place in a social, religious and cultural order. According to \nDurkheim , the horror of losing one’s place in the social and cultural \napparatus drives the individual symptoms of anxiety and depression \nthat lead to suicide.\nOur need for a socially and culturally meaningful  life, according \nto Durkheim ’s social integration theory of suicide , resonates with  the \nexperiences chronicled in Victor Frankl ’s international bestseller, Man’s \nSearch for Meaning  (1946). Frankl makes a case study for the protective \neffect of meaning in one’s life, drawing from his many observations \nof the suffering endured in the concentration camps of the Second \nWorld War . The book’s original German title was …Nevertheless Saying \n“Yes” to Life , which is telling, as Frankl’s exposition of an extreme loss \nof home, culture and community is precisely the kind of condition \nthat can provoke suicide. Frankl’s prescription for enduring involves \nderiving meaning from the hope that these may be restored, and that \nthe seed of restoration already exists within the agent. His method of \nlogotherapy  gives a prescription for self-affirmation when one is “[i]\nn a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in \npositive action, whe n his only achievement may consist in enduring \nhis sufferings in the right way—an honorable way […]” (Frankl 1946), \nhearkening back to the Stoic’s response of the philosopher-physician \n15        http://www.suicide.org/suicide-causes.html , http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Suici  \nde/Pages/Causes.aspx , https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-  \nworld/201004/the-six-reasons-people-attempt-suicide  \n16        This is evidenced, in part, by the observation that global, stable attribution styles \ncontribute to suicide  ideation (Kleiman, Miller, and Riskind 201 2).\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

This alternative, viable way of making \nsense of the world allows one to remain  at home in one’s self , in spite of \nexternal circumstances . The corollary is that suicide must not only be \nconsequent of an agent’s hunger  for meaning; it is also the result of an \ninability to locate any in the arena of the world. The impoverishment \nof worldview  engenders famine . Frankl himself remarks that the \nsuccess of his book is not an accomplishment on his part “but rather \nan expression of the misery of our time: if hundreds of thousands of \npeople reach out for a book whose very title promises to deal with the \nquestion of a meaning to life, it must be a question that burns under \ntheir fingernails” (Frankl 1992: xiii).\n5.2.1 Suicide, Economic Status and Economic Volatility\nOne’s ability to participate in a social and cultural exchange of \nmeaning depends on a basic degree of economic agency. As such, \nwhen the economic standing of individuals or societies is threatened, \nsuicide  rates increase in turn. For instance, the market crash of 2008 \nsaw a mar ked increase in suicides worldwide, mostly in European and \nAmerican men aged 15 and older (Chang et al.  2013). In the US, the rate \nof increase in suicides nearly quadrupled , from 0.12 per 10 0,000 per \nyear in 1999 to 2007, to 0.51 suicides per 100,000 each year from 2008 \nto 2010 (Reeves et al. 2012). Unemployment accounted for a quarter of \nthe variance in suicide during the most recent economic crash (Reeves \net al.  2012), and is so pote nt a pressure that ev en the anticipation of  a rise \nin unemployment rate can lead to an increase in suicide (Stankunas et \nal. 2013).\nThe relationship between economic agency and suicide , however, \nis more nuanced. Durkheim ’s insight was recognizing that economic \nstanding is only one of many interacting factors mediating an \nindividual’s social integration. For instance, the effect of poverty on \nsuicide is not as pronounced as might be expected if economics alone \nare considered. When there is a lower class of which to speak, social \nintegration within that class is possible, and hence the proclivity for \nsuicide decreases. It is, in fact, individuals who face either  the extremes \nof poverty or the extremes of wealth that exhibit an increased propensity \nfor suicide. Additionally, racial gaps in wealth do not correspond to \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n56 \nZombies in Western Culture\nracial gaps in suicide. In the US, for instance, the median net worth of \nwhites in 2014 was at least ten times that of either blacks or Hispanics.17 \nAnd yet, the rate of s uicide among whites is almost four times greater \nthan that of blacks, and three times greater than Hispanics (Curtin, \nWarner, and Hedegaard 2016b). The question, clearly, is less about \neconomic standing per se  and more about economic agency , insofar as \nthe end of such agency is social integration.\nIn the US, suicide  rates have been increasing prior to th e most \nrecent economic crash and ha ve continued to rise since, despite an \neconomic recovery above 2008 levels (Curtin, Warner, and Hedegaard \n2016a). Given the strong effect of unemployment on suicide, it is \nplausible to suggest that a perception in th e faltering of in dividual \nagency in the economic arena  is at least in part responsi ble for this \nsuicide tr end (Chang et al.  2013; Curtin, Warner, and Hedegaard \n2016a; Hempstead and Phillips 2015; Stankunas et al.  2013; Reeves et \nal. 2012). Furthermore, the fact that an economic recovery has done \nnothing to ameliorate the suicide rate suggests that though economic \nstanding may largely be restored, there may nonetheless be a looming \nsense that economic agency  has not.\nPeople have, in part, lost confidence in the institutions that \nare supposed to nurture both individual and collective economic \nprosperity. According to a recent Gallup poll in the US, faith in \neconomic institutions is the lowest since polling began in 1973―a \nstriking 12 percentile points lower.18 The OECD concurs that this \ndisturbing trend is reflected in countries across the globe.19 The \nmarket crash of 2008, now being hailed as the “Great Recession ”, is a \nguttural example of how the machinations of large-scale institutions \ncan threaten individual financial agency. And yet, we have little \nchoice but to open ourselves up to vulnerability. Our dependence on \nthese institutions is stamped into the shape of modern life, such that \nrenouncing them is to renounce modern life altogether.\n17        http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great  \n-recession/  \n18        http://www.gallup.com/poll/183593/confidence-institutions-below-historical-\nnorms.aspx\n19        http://www.oecd.org/forum/the-cost-of-mistrust.htm\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\n5.2.2 Suicide and Political Stability\nPolitical volatility often interacts with economic instability \nsynergistically, corresponding with a greater combined threat to social \nintegration. For instance, during the reinstation of independence in the \nBaltic states in the early nineties, amidst massive unemployment and \npolitical instability, the suicide  rate skyr ocketed, reaching (an d, in the \ncase of Latvia, exceeding) 40 deaths per 100,000―more than triple the \nEU average (Stankunas et al.  2013). Political volatility in this region so \ndramatically saturated the pressures towards social disintegration that \nunemployment rate, which peaked in 2000 and 2001, had no perceptible \neffect on suicide rate (Stankunas et al.  2013). The Baltic states also \nsuffered the worst economic losses of the EU countries in 2008, yet saw \nonly a modest increase in the number of suicides, and still only half \nthe peak rates in the nineties. Once again, it seems apt to say that the \nanticipation of agency being usurped, of losing one’s place in the order \nof things, is fundamentally what drives the anxiety, depression and \nsuicide associated with economic instability, an effect that is amplified \nif one’s agency in the political arena is also threatened.\nAnother relationship between political stability and suicide  is \nDurkheim ’s finding that suicide rates are higher in t imes of peace than \nin war, a finding that has since been confirmed in more contemporary \nstudies of the phenomenon (Osman and Parnell 2015). War  generally \ntends to be a collective dissent towards an external threat, and therefore \ndemands alignment towards common goals―a high degree of social \nintegration. In contrast, in times of relative peace, internal issues \nbecome more focal and so the opportunity for a relative loss of social \nintegration is greater, hence the increase in suicide rate. The exception \nto this, of course, is war waged within a state, referring to Durkheim ’s \npoint concerning political volatility and suicide.\n5.2.3 Suicide, Marital Status and Religious Affiliation\nThe religious “nones”  are spiritually hungry, but they are not finding \nanything to satisfy that hunger. They are the most demonstrable \nmicrocosm of the effect of worldview  famine . Accordingly, sui cide \nrates tend to be higher among  the “nones”  than the religiously \naffiliated both within a socie ty (Dervic  et al. 2004; Hilton, Fellingham , \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n58 \nZombies in Western Culture\nand Lyon 2002), and when the religiosity of different societies \nare compared (Stack 1983; Bertolote and Fleischmann 2002). The \nreligiously disaffi liated also marry and have families less frequently, \nand tend to be more isolated from their  relations ( Dervic et al.  \n2004). Independently, it has been established that marriage  has a \nprotective effect on suicide (Kposowa 2000; Rotermann 2007). This \nsuggests a curious trend among the religiously disaffiliated: they \ncomprehensively reject or are otherwise unable to participate in \nmajor sources of social integration and meaning in life, and therefore \nsystematically lose multiple, independent safeguards against suicide. \nThat the fastest growing religion is no religion at all, as discussed \nin section 5.1 , overwhelmingly signifies that religion no longer \nguarantees such a safeguard; its promise of a meaningful  life is \nbankrupt. The Death of a binding social and religious metanarrative  \nspells death for individuals.\nAltogether, the rising tide of suicide  may indicate that our \neconomic, political, religious and social institutions are failing \nindividuals, and are impotent in helping them to find their place. \nThey fail doubly, too, as they are also unable to point to alternative \nviable means of engaging with the world distinct from the crumbling \nones they offer. As evidenced by the rise of isolated spiritual “nones”  \nand non-voters, people are actively dissenting from these institutions. \nWithout one’s place, and bankrupt of alternatives, hope  is a luxury \none cannot afford, inviting the systematic and self-reinforcing \ndespair from which suicide can follow. As Popper  (1979) said, our \ngreat strength is that we can let our ideas “die in our stead”. When \nwe are starved of alternatives, when there are no ideas left to die in \nus, perhaps death of the body inevitably follows. Culture, as it takes \nroot in the individual, no longer serves to orient the agent in either \nitself or its arena meaningfully. The self is no longer at home in itself: \nsuicide is domicide  in its most interior, personal and radical form. \nIn this sense, the zombie is suicide aborted. The seed of culture has \nmiscarried in the zombie, and the hunger for a way out, rather than \nending itself in a final act of agency, has mutated into the insatiable \ncraving for the sapience lost―a literal hunger for brains.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\n5.3 Pestilence\nFig. 11: Prevalence of the words “zombie” and “disconn ection” from \n1930- 2010 in predominantly English books published in any country.20 \nCulture also informs us in relation to how we should orient ourselves \nto others, and critically, zombies lack any meaningful  relationship to \none another. People are fleeing the collapsing sacred canopies once \nprovided by world religions, flocking instead beneath the makeshift \ntarps of Ersatz mythologies. These echoes of meta-meaning  systems, \nwhile offering wisps of comfort, cannot afford the complete existential \nimport of a genuine meta-meaning system. Owing to their virtuality, \nthey ultimately fail at providing one of the central things they are sought \nout for―close interpersonal relationships―inflicting a myopia that \nseems to make people more distant to us. They are not far-reaching and \ngeneral enough to make others intelligible to us across all the domains \nthat life demands.\nEvidence from the General Social Survey (GSS) paints a bleak picture \nof our interpersonal engagement. From 1985 to 2004, the proportion of \npeople who report havi ng no one to discuss important matters wit h nearly \ntripled, with people reported having 2/3 the number of confidantes t han \nin 1985 (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears 2006).

As the Pew Research Center  corroborates, \nthere is “no ‘smoking gun’ that clearly demonstrates a technical problem \nwith the GSS data”,21 suggesting that the backlash is at least in part as a \nresult of the sheer incredulity towards the data. Pew also found a 30% \ndecrease in the size of core discussion networks.\nInternet and mobile phone users, however, had a more diverse (25%) \nand a slightly larger (12%) social network than non-users. In the UK, time \nspent on the internet by adults has more than doubled from 9.9 hours \nper week in 2005 to 20.5 in 2014.22 This is close to the worldwide median \naverage of 18 hours per week as of 2015.23 Youth aged 16-24 spend more \nthan 27 hours per week online. Given that 40% of time spent on the \ninternet is split between social media (22.7%), gaming (10.2%) and email \n(8.3%), activities that are of a decidedly social character,24 this modest \nincrease in social network size and diversity is hardly commensurate \nwith the effort and energy expended. That internet and mobile phone \nusers have richer social networks than non-users, however, suggests \nthat technology is not itself to blame per se . The quantity and quality of \nour social relationships have perceptibly suffered for reasons that seem \nto be largely independent from the rise in use of these technologies. The \nwant of individuals to “plug in” and stay connected appears to coincide \nwith the massive disconnection they are experiencing.\nMarriage , as a cultural and religious institution meant to foster and \nprotect some of our closest relationships, seems to be failing as well. \nAccording to a Pew Research Poll, while the number of marriages in \n2010 decreased by 28% since 1960, the number of divorces increased \nby 280%. Almost a third of adults have never married, compared to \nhalf that in 1960. And while divorce is on the rise, so is the number \n21        http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2009/PIP_Tech_and_\nSocial_Isolation.pdf  \n22        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyand -telecoms/  \ndigital-media/11597743/Teenagers-spend-27-hours-a-week -online-how-internet-\nuse -has-ballooned-in-the-last-decade.html\n  http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/media-lit-\n10years /2015_Adults_media_use_and_attitudes_report.pdf  \n23        http://www.statista.com/statistics/267518/weekly-internet-usage-worldwide/  \n24        http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2010/what-americans-do-online-\nsocial-media-and-games-dominate-activity.html  \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nof prenuptial agreements, according to a survey conducted by the \nAmerican Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. The survey noted that \n63% of lawyers reported an increase in prenuptial agreements from \n2010-2013, and that prenuptial agreements have also been on the rise \nfor the past 30 years.25 Though prenuptial agreements are fairly rare \n(only about 5% of marriages), their rise may be telling of an increasing \nmistrust of the institution, predicated on a pessimism and premonition \nof failure. That we are increasingly inclined to place more faith in our \nmoney than in other persons is troubling.\nThis is particularly ironic considering the economic incentives for \nmarriage . On average, the earning potential for married households is \n41% greater than for the non-married. And this has actually increased \nfrom only 12% in 1960.26 Although people are marrying later in life, \nand people with higher education are more likely to marry―both of \nwhich contribute to earning potential―fiscal stability is often cited as \na major consideration in the choice of partner, irrespective of personal \nsocioeconomic status. \nThough marriage  may be declining, the want for close interpersonal \nrelationships and family is not. 98% of adults say family is one of the \nmost important aspects of their lives, with 76% saying it is the most \nimportant thing in their lives. Just as we seem to be shirking from \nreligion but still hunger for what it provides, the institution of marriage \nseems unable to ensure the holiness  of matrimony, yet we sti ll desire the \ncloseness it once provided.27\nThere is a strong association between social isolation and suicide  \n(Stravynski and Boyer 2011). Even discounting suicide, social isolation \nand loneliness increase  mortality b y 32% (Holt-Luns tad et al.  2015). As \ndiscussed in section 5.2.3 , married individuals are also less likely to \ncommit suicide (Kposowa 2000; Rotermann 2007). And so, we can begin \nto piece together a clockwork catastrophe whose ruin has been set into \nmotion by the invisible hand of the meaning crisis. Suicide rates are \non the r ise.

ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n62 \nZombies in Western Culture\nsuicide. Marriage  decreases the likelihood of suicide (Kposowa 2000), \nand divorce rates are on the rise. Cultural involvement shields against \nsuicide, and religious disaffiliation is on the rise. The religious “nones”  \nfeel that luck is more important than hard work, reflecting a damaged \nsense of self-efficacy and hopelessness.28 Systematic hopelessness can \nspiral into depression and social isolation. Untreated depression is the \nleading cause of suicide. A self-reinforcing system is thereby created, \nthe causes and effects indistinguishable from each other. They are at \nwar within themselves. It is as though we have tools that are no longer \nserving us, so we are wrenching at them, turning them over, trying \ndesperately to find a way to keep them in use, as they blunt before our \neyes, and we beat them ever more harshly.\n5.4 War\nIf suicide  evidences detachment from self, and the rise in divorce \nand social isolation indicates detachment from others, then political \ndisengagement indicates an appreciable detachment from the state and \nfrom political machinery. In 2014, voter turnout  for the midterm election \nin the US was the lowest it had been since World War II. Worldwide, \nthe picture is just as troubling: since 1945, voter turnout in democratic \ncountries has decreased by 12% (Pintor, Gratschew, and Sullivan 2002; \nSolijonov 2016). \nIt seems that―as in the Hellenistic  era―we are once again afflicted \nby a feeling of diminishment in our political agency, a loss of faith in the \ntraction of political institutions, and a disbelief in the political apparatus \nas an instrument to underwrite the volition of society. But from here, \nthe historical parallels are limited. While the anxiety triggered by \nmodern Western pluralism  (or in some cases, its perception) may well \nbe compared to those experienced in the Hellenistic  period, the causal \nparities are not nearly as obvious. This time, there is no single historical \nshift―even the fall of the Soviet Union, or some significant event \nbesides―that bears responsibility for the reduced political motility, or \nfor general agnosticism toward political participation. The diffuseness \nof the trend makes it more difficult to source. \n28        http://www.statisticbrain.com/percent-who-believe-in-the-power-of-hard-work/  \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nThe circularity of the political system poses another diagnostic \nproblem. If we face deterioration in the efficacy in our political \ninstitutions, it is simultaneous with a divestment in the belief of its \ncitizenry. What follows, it would seem, is a loosening of the relationship \nbetween the elected and their electorate, and between the individual \nand the institutions to which they ostensibly belong. Though political \nsystems do not independently constitute worldviews (in the model \nof the meta-meaning  system, the sphere of political relations is sub-\ncategorical to the parent function that religion once served) they do \nconsist of an agent/arena ecology similar to that of the larger worldview . \nIf this relation becomes unglued, then the system―dependent upon \nthe mutual fittedness and interdefinition between the institutions and \nthe participants―is no longer sustainable. If individuals are no longer \ninclined to participate meaningfully in the political process to at least a \nminimum standard, then the system is severely at risk of failure. \nThere are clear signs that such a failure is occurring, and for these we \nneed look no further than to the centre of our modern political nervous \nsystem. In the first section  of this book, we discussed the breakdown \nof Americanism , and the cultural discontinuities that are threatening \nto dilute the potency of the “ American” signifier. America is the most \npowerful political entity of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and \nit serves as a paradigm for the health of the democratic political machinery \nand its requisite social capital. We proposed in section 2  that a vernacular \nreligiosity powered the apotheosis of American identification, and that \nthe vitality of its institutions―politics included―was linked to a “faith \nin America” which was at once religious and not exclusively religious.  \nThis faith was a paragon of worldview  attunement , the hub at the centre \nof a moving wheel, anchoring all spokes of American life and culture. \nIt seems reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the decline of religious \nparticipation (our first horseman) in the United States, exemplified by \nthe rise of the “nones” , has prefigured the disunion of the political agent \nand arena. If both losses are generalizable in the West at large, it seems \nplausible to suggest that, even on this scale, the two types of agnostics \nare co-emergent. Analysis of exit poll data for the 2014 US midterm \nelection, for instance, reveals that although the “nones”  constitute an \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

All rights reserved. \n64 \nZombies in Western Culture\nincreasingly larger sect of the population, they still only constitute \naround 12% of voters, unchanged since 2006.29\nFurthermore, the growing sense of velleity in civic participation \nseems at odds with the advocacy-driven, often intractable politics related \nto our social and cultural dilemmas.30 However apathetic we may be \ntoward the formal offices of politics, we are increasingly politicized on \nthe topics of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and religious affiliation \n(or lack thereof), and increasingly trenchant about staking and \ndefending our identities therein. It seems plausible that our elevated \nidentification with these modalities is also symptomatic of our cultural \ndomicide ; it is a victual substitute for religious involvement, satiating \nour appetites for community and social coherence. In the absence of \nour sacred canopy , these partial modes of identification are overdrawn \nto meet the elements. They are exapted as pseudo-religious domiciles, \nshelters of culture to huddle within as we fend off encroachment by the \nzombies―elements of “strangeness” in the post-war  world.31 \nThese pseudo-religious domiciles, drawn from the matrix of social \nidentities are attempting to cheat Death by anesthetizing the symptoms \nof the other three horsemen; countering Famine  with self-affirmation, \nfighting Pestilence  with tribalism, and parrying War  with politicization. \nIn doing so, they are colligating each sphere of relations through a \nsingular framework, like beams of light concentrated through a prism.\nThe problem with these worldview  substitutes is that they are \ninhibited by procrustean heuristics. Though they can virtually govern \ntheir existing denizens (advocates or members), they cannot suffice \nas meta-meaning  systems precisely because they already function \nas single-meaning  systems―they relate to one mode of identification, \nand they do not have the versatility to appropriate other systems \n29        http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/05/how-the-faithful-voted-2014-preliminary-\nanalysis/  \n30        It is worth noting that the increase in protest, advocacy and intense politicization \nin the wake of Trump’s election has not translated into participation in the actual \npolitical machinery available (i.e. anti-Trump sentiment seems not to have drawn \npeople to the Democratic Party or otherwise resulted in the emergence of new \npolitical entities).\n31        We are speaking here of the dichotomy between two increasingly contrasting \nphenomena: general civic apathy and politicized modes of identification. We are \nnot disputing the existence of valid political causes or the integrity of advocacy \nindependent from any cultural meaning crisis. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

Neither do they become more complex as part of their \nfunction. Uniform collectives offer insulation rather than social \nexposure or diversification. Political advocacy often centers on specific \ntopics rather than generalizable patterns or dynamics. And as would-be \ncomprehensive frameworks, single systems are necessarily reductive; \nthey attempt to integrate phenomena into an explanatory framework, \nbut those frameworks have limited usefulness because they are only \napplicable to the system from which they originate. Like the Ersatz \nmythologies discussed in section 5.1 , they cannot export a prescription \nfor action that becomes useful even when placed in multiple domains \nor situations. The fact that one group finds a system deeply meaningful  \ndoes not define that system as a worldview. It is wide and efficacious \napplicability among different groups that makes it a worldview.\nIt is telling perhaps that these modes of identification have become \nincreasingly political when our participation in politics has declined \nso appreciably. We may venture to say that the politicization of social \nidentities is a reaction to the divestment from the political process as \nsuch―a process that was once chief inheritor to the religious worldview . \nConsequently, it is likely that our recent divestment from politics qua \npolitics is, at least in part, responsive to the disastrous outcome of the \npolitical deification that occurred in the twentieth century. \nAs politics is, by necessity of governance, naturally integrative \nof other systems, it was a proximal replacement for the meta-\nmeaningfulness of religion at the end of the nineteenth century. Though \nthe machinations of politics and political identification historically fell \nunder the normativity of the religious canopy, its systemic complexity \nmade it the nearest and most convincing imitator of that normativity as \nthe influence of religion diminished. The twentieth century therefore \nbore witness to the rise of the most potent political pseudo-religions  \nwe have known in the modern world. These of course, were the \ntotalitarian , nationalist ideologies of Marxism , espoused by the Soviet \nUnion, and National Socialism , espoused by Nazi  Germany midway \nthrough the century. Not merely instruments of governance, these \npolitical ideologies grew to espouse a creedal fundamentalism  we \nmight equate with the most zealous form of religious fealty. They were \nnot merely inhibitive, as other pseudo-religious substitutes described \nabove, but widely destructive.

All rights reserved. \n66 \nZombies in Western Culture\nare well known to us: though they galvanized millions of adherents \ninitially, these political ideologies were so ill-adapted to the religious \nproject that they conditioned unprecedented scales of violence and \ngenocide. The horseman of War  is uncannily suited to describe the fate \nof these pseudo-religions as they became more and more widespread \nthroughout Europe, Asia and the Americas. \nIf once again we take the relocation of the Grassy Narrows  as an \nanalogue for spiritual domicide , we might say that the totalitarian  \npolitical ideologies of the twentieth century were the square walls \nsuperimposed onto the circular dynamic of the religious worldview  \n(and in this case, infinitely more overweening). Likewise, the 4th century \ndomicide after the death of Alexander shows us what may ensue when \ngreat seats of power fail and diminish. In the wake of the last century, \nit became clear that if political systems aspired in earnest to a religious \nlevel of meta-meaning , they would not only be insufficient, but also \ninimical to our culture and way of life. It is perhaps little surprise, then, \nthat voter turnout  has declined since the fall of Nazi  Germany. The \nnotion that politics, operating as a superordinate governor, can offer \nanything remotely like spiritual restitution, is no longer au courant. \nThough pseudo-religious nationalism is by no means extinguished, \nour culture’s relationship to the political establishment has changed \ndrastically since the last World War. Voter turnout rates illustrate this, \nand so do the prevailing attitudes expressed in our popular culture. The \nrabid fundamentalism  of the twentieth century ideologues has, when \nnot transferred to the social enclaves described above, largely been \nreplaced with an obverse attitude: cynicism . Rather than the majority \nof individuals identifying strongly with specific political parties or \norganizations, many reject the pretention of any political membership \nat all. Like the religious “nones” , the non-affiliation does not reflect \nan insouciance towards political agency, but merely a lack of faith in \nthe efficacy of the existing political architecture―hence, a comparable \nbreakdown of the agent/arena ecology, conditioned by a disbelief in the \nrelation itself.\nAs cynicism  is aloof by orientation, it is more spontaneous, and a \nmore difficult phenomenon to demystify than ideological zealousness. \nIn this way, it bears some attitudinal affinity with the decentralized, \nequivocal structures found in capitalist systems (see also Moreman 2010; \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 67\n5. The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nWebb and Byrnand 2008). There appears to be some correspondence \nbetween the pervasiveness of these two Western hallmarks, capitalism \nand cynicism―a sense of inscrutability, a difficulty with determining \naccountability, and most of all, an inability to ascertain our own influence \non such a system (recall: the Grassy Narrows  elder’s meditations, and \nthe Hellenistic  estrangement between individual and the structures of \nthe state). All of this conduces to a Kafkaesque sense of detachment; the \nperception that an individual’s actions are futile in a world where causal \nrules are oblique. It also increases the number of unaffiliated persons as \npeople find less and less of themselves  in the institutions they work for,32 \nin the governments that represent them, and in the monetary structures \nthat they must use to fulfill their homeostatic needs.\nOur cultural cynicism  seems germane to our feeling of futility, which \nin turn refers us to our Kafkaesque impression of absurdity from the \nworld outside. Accentuating this impression is the loss of some central \nadhesive to our perspectives; our ability to index our environment―\nto gain a readable purchase over our surroundings―is waning. This \nis because the information we obtain from the world, which becomes \nthe epistemic leverage in our decision making, has never been more \nunreliable. Abundance is one dimension of this problem; one need look \nno further than news media to appreciate the sheer volume of (often \nirreconcilable) narratives that compete for authority over our attention. \nFar more critical, however, is the degree to which these narratives are \nunconcerned with their own verity, and whether the impetus for their \ncommunication has anything at all do with their relationship to reality \nas such (see also Keyes 2004).\nThis lingering question now casts doubt over the trustworthiness \nof all but the most verifiable assertions, whether they are made by \nindividuals, groups or entire states. The degree to which the contents \nof published works, the utterances of politicians, the press releases of \ninstitutions and the opinions of individuals are rhetorically attractive \nis not, of course, the degree to which they are true. Yet we feel with \nincreasing dismay that the attractiveness of our expressions is favored \n32        In the US, employee engagement hovers around 30% ( http://www.gallup.com/\ntopic/employee_engagement.aspx ), and a worldwide survey of 142 countries \nrevealed that only 13% of employees describe themselves as engaged in their work \n(http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx ).\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The prioritization of appearance \nover reality, duplicated noisily in our social media driven environment, \nand appropriated to great effect by the political establishment, has \nreinforced and empowered our cynicism . Nowhere is this magnification \nmore evident than in the rise of satirical news programs, which \nrecapitulate political doublespeak as the basis of their comedy. Far from \nbeing persuasive, these programs presuppose the cynicism of their \nviewership, and this is the basis of their success. The disingenuousness \nof our institutions has long since been taken for granted, and on several \noccasions (one famous instance took place during Jon Stewart ’s final \nmoments as host of the Daily Show ) it has been given a recognizable \nsignifier. To understand the signifier properly, we must look to a famous \nessay on the subject by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt : “On Bullshit ” \n(Frankfurt and Wilson 2005).\n5.4.1 Reality Disengaged: On Bullshit\nFig. 12: Prevalence  of the use of the words “zombie” and “bullshit ” from \n1930-2008 in predominantly English books published in any country.33\nIt is very important, in Frankfurt’s formulation, not to confuse bullshit \nwith a lie. The two differ in one all-important respect―namely, in \ntheir relationship with the truth. A lie and truth share something very \nsignificant: they share a concern for realness . The liar and the truth-teller \n33  From Google N-Gram Viewer, smoothing factor of 3 (Michel et al.  2011).\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 69\n5. The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\npossess a mutual appreciation for the depth of genuineness because in \nthe case of both, that depth is the referent for their actions―supported \nby the truth teller or subverted by the liar. The lie and the truth both \npresuppose an appreciation of the actuality they treat. The liar must \nknow the truth in order to identify it, and she must find it consequential \nfor want to sabotage it. A lie is told to purposefully controvert the truth―\nit presupposes the importance of truth in desiring to undermine it. We \nmight say then that a lie is told with respect to the truth. Mindfulness \nof the truth is essential to the projects of both the liar and the truth-\nteller. Bullshit  is so defined because it is not troubled in the least with \nactuality. Bullshit  may be true or untrue. Either way, it is unconcerned. \nIt has no commitment to the truth for better or for worse. It publishes \nitself irrespective to the status of its own reality. \nFrankfurt’s (2005) theoretical explication of bullshit  aids in \nconceptualizing self-deception far more effectively than lying does. \nHuman beings cannot lie to themselves. We cannot know “p” and then \npromptly believe “not p”. We cannot know we have $1,000 dollars in the \nbank account and then believe that we have $100,000. Even if we desire \nto, we cannot knowingly invert our apprehension of the truth. Lying to \noneself is an inadequate, unhelpful model for explaining self-deception.\nBullshit  is not about making things real, it is about making things \nsalient. The bullshitter means to direct your attention not to the truth \nor untruth of an idea, but to the catchiness of an idea: a politician tells \na crowd of applauding supporters that their country is the best in the \nworld; a commercial shows beautiful women clinging to the arms of a \ngawky man as he opens a bottle of beer; a company changes the color \nof their brand and calls it “new and improved”; a student prints her \nessay on a smoother stationary before handing it in to be marked. \nEveryone knows the attractiveness of these objects is both irrational \nand immaterial. The crowd before the politician knows full well that \ntheir country is in dire straits but they applaud anyway. The professor \nreading the paper knows it is not well argued but enjoys turning the \npages. Grocery shoppers can see that the ingredients of the cereal brand \nhaven’t changed, but they’re tempted to buy the new box. Male viewers \nare well aware that holding a particular label of beer will not enhance \ntheir sexual appeal. And yet in spite all of this knowing, they are still \nlikely to buy that particular beer. This salience slippage is not a rational \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n70 \nZombies in Western Culture\nphenomenon. We know there is no truth to any of these associations. \nEven the brands admit (and often wink at) the fact that the images most \nidentified with their brands depict false correlations. Yet this is not \nscandalous to anyone because the branders are not making propositions \nthat we consider on the basis of their being true or false. Nor, oftentimes, \nis the politician. She is not making an argument using the elements of \nreason. She is giving herself an extra sheen of salience. Salience grabs \nyour attention, but by directing your attention, you can make things \nsalient so that they grab your attention even more. The directives of \nthat salience can be entirely disconnected from the depth of realness , \nand when this happens, you seek merely the catchiness of the idea, \nthe person, or the prospect, and not the substance of its consequence \nor the reservoir of its competence. You can bullshit yourself merely by \ndirecting your attention to certain things over others, selecting certain \ndetails over others, and choosing certain expressions over others simply \nbecause they come to you more quickly… because you have conditioned \nyourself to favor them automatically. We can build a commitment to \nmodels of thinking and acting solely based on their salience. We can \ncondition ourselves into retaining an idea regardless of its integrity. Our \nconcern for relevance can come at the cost of our concern for truth. This \nbegins a circle of self-deceptive behavior. \nBullshit  and self-deception are infectiously versatile. They can be \ntransmitted by individuals and institutions alike, and in many cases \nadhere the relationship between the two. As one may imagine, this is \npoisonous for the agent/arena ecology. If the basis of this relation is \npolluted by bullshit, it can have one of two deleterious outcomes. It \nmay inspire heedlessness  on the part of the agent, in which her attention \nbecomes attracted only to salience, and her beliefs and orientations \nbecome completely subsumed into the purported appearances of an \nindividual, institution or set of ideas. This complete surrender to self-\ndeception makes her extremely vulnerable to ideological extremism \nand fundamentalism . Vigorous cynicism  is the other outcome, whereby \nthe individual dismisses herself from involvement in any of these \nrelations. She assumes a position of absolute disbelief and forecloses the \npossibility of partaking in the ecology, even where it is unpolluted, and \nwould connect her meaningfully to the world. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 71\n5. The Four Horsemen  of the Zombie Apocalypse\nSignificantly, these two positions are not mutually exclusive, nor as \ndistinguishable as they would seem. Heedless belief often transforms into \ncynicism  when a once undiscerning individual is abruptly disillusioned. \nInversely, we have said that cynicism does not remove the appetite for \nauthenticity, and in the case of political relationships, cynicism can be \nappropriated when it becomes its own basis for political mobilization. \nIronically, devout cynicism can make an individual vulnerable to self-\ndeception when it affectively bonds her to other, similar expressions, \nsuch that it becomes the singular criterion that guides her relationships \nand involvement with the world. Singular criteria like this provide \ndangerously low thresholds for influence and persuasion.\nWe are presently seeing the inter-penetration of these two forms of \nself-deception in political arenas around the world. Yet again, nowhere \nis the evidence more powerful than in the United States. The decline \nof the American religiosity, the disproportionately pale declarations \nof pseudo-religious substitutes, and the overall disbelief in the \ncommunicability of truth in politics has suffused the culture with a \nsense of disenfranchisement. The feeling of futility embedded in this \noverall zeitgeist has proved volatile, and has inspired increasingly \nradical demonstrations against the “establishment” viz. not only sitting \ngovernments or institutions, but the systemic environment (read: \necology) in which they operate. Unsurprisingly, these demonstrations \nhave often struggled to articulate the complexity of their grievances. \nIn 2011, the Occupy Wall Street  movement declared itself against the \nabsurd inequalities of capitalism writ large. The election year of 2016 \nsaw the rise of political candidates Donald Trump  and Bernie Sanders  \nwho, each in their partisan vestments, spoke glibly about the erosion \nof the American apotheosis and electrified the electorate with an \nuncommonly radical denunciation of the American establishment and \ntheir solidarity with the disenfranchised. Their perceived “authenticity” \n(whether genuine or not) has been embraced as a counterpoise to the \nquotidian bullshit  of everyday life―a war, as it were, against the \nstultification of civilian life, and the rediscovery of a “greatness” that is \nbarely recollected.\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

This framework was dismantled by theological shifts like the Protestant Reformation and scientific discoveries of the Copernican Revolution, which severed humanity's connection to a purposeful and intelligible universe.",
      "long_summary": "This is a detailed summary of Chapter 6, \"An Introduction to the Genealogy of the Meaning Crisis,\" from the book *Zombies in Western Culture*.\n\n### **Overall Thesis**\n\nThe chapter argues that the modern \"meaning crisis\" is a form of **historical domicide**—the loss of a conceptual home or worldview. This crisis stems from the historical disintegration of three interconnected and mutually supporting \"orders\" that once provided Western culture with a coherent and meaningful understanding of the cosmos, humanity's place within it, and a guide for how to live.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: The Meaning That Was Lost: The Three Orders of a Worldview**\n\nThis section describes the integrated worldview that existed before its collapse, which was composed of three fundamental orders.\n\n#### **6.1.1 The Nomological Order: A Purposeful Cosmos**\n\n*   **Origin:** The Aristotelian worldview.\n*   **Core Concept:** A deep, structural conformity between the human mind and objective reality. To \"know\" something was for the mind to grasp its essential structure or \"form.\"\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Mind-World Affinity:** The mind was perfectly suited to understand the world because the world was inherently intelligible and structured.\n    *   **Purposeful Universe (Teleology):** Everything in the cosmos had an intrinsic purpose and direction. Smoke naturally rose to the clouds, heavy objects naturally fell to the earth, which was the center of a beautiful and ordered universe.\n    *   **Reliable Perception:** Reality could be reliably determined through a checklist: ensuring one's senses were functioning, the medium (e.g., air) was clear, and one's perception had consensus with others.\n    *   **Result:** This order provided a profound sense of belonging and understanding. The world made sense, and humans had a secure place within its rational structure.\n\n#### **6.1.2 The Narrative Order: A Cosmic Story**\n\n*   **Origin:** The integration of Aristotelian metaphysics with Christian theology, most notably by Thomas Aquinas.\n*   **Core Concept:** History is not a repeating cycle (as in the Greek view) but a linear **metanarrative** with a beginning, middle, and end: Creation, Fall, and Redemption.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **A Singular Story:** The life, death, and resurrection of Christ is the central, pivotal event that gives all of history a single, overarching purpose (*telos*).\n    *   **Meaningful Place:** Individual lives and stories were not random but fit meaningfully into this grand cosmic narrative.\n    *   **Human Agency:** This order introduced the idea that human actions could meaningfully intervene and impact the course of cosmic history, moving it toward its ultimate conclusion.\n\n#### **6.1.3 The Normative Order: A Path to the Divine**\n\n*   **Origin:** A synthesis of Greek philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus) and Christian spirituality (Augustine, Aquinas).\n*   **Core Concept:** Reality is structured as a hierarchy of being and value, and humans can ascend this hierarchy through a process of rational self-transcendence, driven by love, to achieve union with the divine (God).\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Hierarchy of Being:** Reality was seen as a scale from \"matter\" (pure, formless potential) to increasingly complex \"form\" (intelligible structure). Humans, as rational and self-realizing beings, were more \"in-formed\" and thus more \"real\" than animals or inanimate objects.\n    *   **Rational Self-Transcendence:** The pursuit of wisdom and rationality was a process of becoming more real by connecting more deeply with the fundamental structure of reality.\n    *   **Love as the Driving Force:** Christian thinkers like Augustine identified this desire for the real as a form of love. This love drove reason toward a mystical union with God, who represented ultimate reality.\n    *   **A Guide for Life:** This order provided a clear moral and spiritual framework, telling people what was good, what to love, and how to live in order to fulfill their potential and connect with the divine.\n\n**Integration:** These three orders were woven together into a powerful, coherent worldview. The **Narrative** of God's love inspired the **Normative** ascent toward God, which was possible because of the **Nomological** connection between the rational mind and the purposeful cosmos. The world was beautiful, meaningful, and spiritual, and people knew their place within it.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: How the Meaning Was Lost: The Fall of the Three Orders**\n\nThis section details the historical, theological, and scientific developments that led to the unraveling of this integrated worldview.\n\n#### **6.2.1 The Supremacy of Will over Reason**\n\n*   **Catalyst:** The Black Death created massive social trauma and demographic shifts, fostering a new sense of individual self-determination.\n*   **Spiritual Shift (Rhineland Mystics):** The path to God was reinterpreted not as a rational ascent but as an act of **will**—a self-negation to create an emptiness into which God's will could descend.\n*   **Theological Shift (William of Ockham):** Ockham argued that God's **will** is primary, not his reason. God is not bound by rationality; His will is arbitrary and absolute. This led to **nominalism**: the idea that categories we use to order the world (like \"forest\") are just linguistic conveniences, not reflections of an inherent cosmic structure.\n*   **Impact:** The marriage between reason and the mystical was broken, undermining the **Normative Order**. The divine became non-rational and arbitrary, and the world's intrinsic value was diminished.\n\n#### **6.2.2 Luther and the Narcissistic Self**\n\n*   **Luther's Theology:** Building on these ideas, Martin Luther experienced the self not as something to be perfected but as inherently degenerate, self-loathing, and trapped in self-obsession.\n*   **Salvation by Arbitrary Grace:** Since the self is corrupt, salvation cannot be earned through rational or moral ascent. It must be imposed from the outside by God's non-rational, arbitrary will (grace), which is accepted through faith alone.\n*   **Cultural Consequences:**\n    1.  **A Cultural Training in Narcissism:** This theology trained people to see themselves as vacuous and self-hating, constantly seeking unearned, external validation to feel worthy.\n    2.  **Radical Individualism and Pluralism:** The Protestant Reformation made faith a private, individual matter. As Protestantism fractured into countless sects, \"God\" became a purely internal experience, losing its shared public meaning and becoming an increasingly meaningless term.\n    3.  **Loss of Wisdom Institutions:** The shutting down of monasteries in Protestant countries separated the university (for acquiring knowledge) from the monastery (for cultivating wisdom and self-transformation). This left the growing cultural narcissism unchecked.\n\n#### **6.2.3 Pluralism and the Copernican Revolution**\n\n*   **Scientific Revolution's Impact:**\n    *   **Copernicus:** His heliocentric model proved that direct human experience and consensus could be fundamentally wrong. This shattered the trust between the mind and the world, destroying the foundation of the **Nomological Order**. Mathematics, not sensory experience, became the language of reality.\n    *   **Galileo:** His discovery of inertial motion revealed that objects move not because of an internal purpose but because of accidental external forces. This stripped the universe of its inherent purpose and direction.\n*   **Final Collapse:**\n    *   **The Narrative Order Falls:** A universe of random collisions has no overarching story or purpose. Humans became purposive agents in a fundamentally purposeless arena.\n    *   **The Normative Order Falls:** Without intrinsic purpose (\"form\"), there is no value-based hierarchy in reality. Matter is just substance, and form is just accidental shape.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe collapse of the Nomological, Narrative, and Normative orders constitutes a comprehensive breakdown of the **agent-arena correspondence**—the essential fit between a person and their world that allows for a coherent worldview. This historical domicide has left Western culture in a state of meaning crisis. The chapter concludes by stating that the symbol of the **zombie apocalypse** exemplifies this loss, representing the \"Gray Life\" that results from living in a world stripped of these three vital orders.",
      "chapter_text": "6. An Introduction to the Genealogy \nof the Meaning Crisis\nIn section 4 , we discussed the modern domicide  of the Grassy Narrows  \nFirst Nation, and the historical domicide of the Hellenistic  Era. Now, \nwe turn our attention to a more encompassing historical domicide. The \nmeaning crisis has its historical origins in the disintegration of three \nvery powerful orders of a worldview  that had previously helped us to \nmake sense of the world. We provide an overview of this genealogy  \nin the following section , reserving a more extensive discussion for a \nforthcoming monograph.1 \n6.1 The Meaning that Was Lost:  \nThree Orders of a Worldview\n6.1.1 Nomological Order \nThe first of these connections was cradled by the Aristotelean worldview , \nwhere there existed a powerful affinity between objective reality and \nsubjective perception. This worldview had two components: an account \nof how the mind viewed the world, and an account of how that world \nwas structured. For Aristotle , these accounts were integrated and \nmutually supporting. To know something was to understand its form, \n1        See Mark Taylor’s After God  as a work influencing the arguments in this section \n(Taylor 2007).\n© 2017 J. Vervaeke, C. Mastropietro, F. Miscevic, CC BY 4.0  https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0113.06\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n74 \nZombies in Western Culture\nbut “form” didn’t primarily mean the shape of a thing. It meant the deep \nstructure that governed its organization. A bird, for instance, was not \nconstituted by features and anatomy (feathers, talons, beak, flight, etc.) \nbut from the underlying structure by which these features were cohered \nand animated. And just as hand conforms to the spatial organization of \nan object when grasping it, so does the mind conform to the structural \norganization of the world when it notionally grasps its structure. This \nwas the Aristotelean knowing, a deep, structural conformity between \nmind and world. \nOne of the most fortifying elements of Aristotle ’s worldview  \nwas that it allowed criteria for falsification, a checklist for reliably \ndetermining whether or not something in the world was real: (1) ensure \nthe perceiving organ was not malfunctioning (i.e. the quality of our \neyesight), (2) that the intervening medium was not distorted (clarity of \nday or night) and (3) that the perception had consensus with others. \nPerception that passes these tests imbues information ―it possesses the \nperceiving individual of the form  of the thing perceived. \nAristotle ’s affinity between mind and world extended and reflected \nthe mind’s intentionality into the properties of the universe. Everything \nmoved with purpose in this worldview , and an intrinsic sense of \nbelonging coordinated the natural direction of all actions and objects \n(smoke to clouds, objects to earth, etc.). The earth was at the centre of a \npurposeful cosmos, an inherently beautiful and ordered place that made \nsense to us, resonated with our experience and gave us the sense of \nunderstanding the world and our place within it. Since it has to do with \nthe fundamental principles by which knowledge and reality co-operate, \nwe call this worldview the Nomological Order  (“nomos” means law or \nrule). \n6.1.2 Narrative Order  \nAristotle ’s purposeful worldview  was so compelling that when \nChristian  thinkers encountered it in the Middle Ages , they found \nit threatening to their theology, but impossible to ignore. The most \ninfluential of these thinkers, Thomas Aquinas , worked hard to integrate \nAristotle’s metaphysics with important ordonnances of the Christian \nworldview. Yet there was an important change in the adaptation of the \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 75\n6. An Introduction to the Genealogy of the Meaning Crisis\nAristotelean framework. In the Greek world, time, like the heavens, \nwas understood as a cyclical movement. For the Christians however, \nfollowing the Jews and Zoroastrians before them, time was a line with \na narrative, consisting of a beginning, middle, and end. Moreover, it \nwas the unfolding of a story: the creation, fall, and redemption of the \nworld. This metanarrative , applied to Aristotle’s purposeful cosmos, \nanchored the affinity of person and universe to the symbolic narrative \nof Christ ’s death and resurrection . This singular, intervening event \nturned the repeating cycle into a single arc, creating a definite telos \nwithin a single cosmic story, and a climax for all converging purposes \nin Aristotle’s perfectly cohered universe. \nThis metanarrative  teleology, which we will call the Narrative Order , \nprovided an overarching story into which the minutia of the cosmos―\nindividuals and their own stories―could fit and belong. Further, it \nintroduced the idea that the agency of persons could intervene in \nthe cycle of repetition and meaningfully impact the course of cosmic \nhistory. \n6.1.3 Normative Order\nThomas Aquinas  was also instrumental to the emergence of a third \norder, born from a marriage  of Greek and Christian  spirituality. The \nformer, originating with Plato  and Aristotle , emphasized a process of \nrational self-transcendence. For Aristotle, “form” was the blueprint of \nintelligible structure for all reality’s objects. The stuff that it imbued \nwith organization was otherwise unstructured and chaotic. Aristotle \ncalled this stuff “matter”―not physical material, but pure, formless \npotential that was unknowable in nature. Form created a purposed \nreality from matter, just as a chair is made from wood that could \notherwise be used to make a variety of other objects. It is the form of \n“chair” that fashions the object from the material. Form was the DNA \nthat turned inanimate matter into life. It in-formed mere possibility \nwith knowable, intelligible reality. \nIn Aristotle ’s framework, form was not simply a binary to matter, \nbut marked a scale of being with increasing rationality, a hierarchy \nof complexity and intelligibility. Living beings were more in-formed \nthan inanimate objects because their form had agency. They were \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n76 \nZombies in Western Culture\nself-moving. Human beings were more in-formed still, not only \nself-moving, but self-moving in thought―rational, self-realizing, \nand commensurately more real. For Plotinus , who integrated Plato  \nand Aristotle, this rising scale of realness  marked a journey to self-\ntranscendence and realization. It reflected a fundamental desire to \ndeepen one’s connection with reality. This insight was powerful. It \nconnected the rationality of self-movement to the process of realization: \nthe more rational a being, the more it structurally organized itself to \nbecome more real, and the more connected it became to the structure \nof reality as such. \nFor Christian  thinkers in the ancient world, such as Augustine  \n(who read Plotinus ), this pursuit of rational self-realization and self-\ntranscendence, i.e. the pursuit of wisdom, was motivated, as Plato  \nhad realized, by a deep love for what is real. For Augustine , reason’s \ncapacity for self-transcendence was dependent on this Platonic desire, \nand it drove a process of ascension whereby we could transcend our \nreason and be in conformity to ultimate reality, a mystical union \nwith God. Love was an extension of Aristotle ’s rational process, and \ndrove the practices of reason and wisdom to form a Platonic-Christian \nspirituality that Aquinas was able to integrate into the Aristotelean \nworldview . The product of this integration was the Normative Order , \nreference to an ontological structure that connected us fundamentally \nto reality, and therein, in-formed us about the nature of good, setting \nforth a hierarchy of values that could tell us what to seek and what to \nlove, that we may ascend the levels of reality and fulfill the potential \nof our self-moving, rational soul. \nThese three orders, the Nomological Order, the Narrative Order , \nand the Normative Order , became tightly integrated and mutually \nsupporting. The story of God’s love (narrative order ) inspired the \nrational-mystical ascension to God (normative order ) through the \ndeep connection between the rational mind and the structure of the \ncosmos (nomological order ). The world was inherently meaningful , \nbeautiful, rational, valuable, and spiritual. We were all tightly \nconnected to this cosmos, and we had a coherent place and purpose \nwithin it. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

An Introduction to the Genealogy of the Meaning Crisis\n6.2 How the Meaning Was Lost: The Fall of the \nThree Orders\n6.2.1 Supremacy of Will over Reason \nThe unravelling of the three orders is not a single historical incident, \nbut was likely preconditioned by the Black Death in Europe. The plague \ncreated a significant labor shortage that sparked a sudden increase \nin demographic relocation. The abrupt trauma to Europe’s social \nstructures, combined with increased economic self-reliance, gave rise \nto a new sense of personal self-determination. This expressed itself \nspiritually as well as economically. Within Germany, the Rhineland \nmystics  began to articulate a new understanding of mystical experience \nand the spiritual life. The ascent to God within the normative order  was \nstill driven by love, but it was now understood as a force of will instead \nof the self-transcendence of reason. Mystical experience was no longer \nseen as the culmination of human rationality, but as a self-negation \nof the will, a re-ordering of the psyche that created an emptiness into \nwhich God’s will would flow. The ascent to God through Platonic love \nwas replaced by the descent of God into the vacancy of the self, which \nwas no longer something to be completed or perfected, but something \nan individual must shed to make room for the divine. \nThis new form of spirituality had important implications for how \npeople of the middle ages understood God. William of Ockham  and \nother similar-minded theologians posited that God’s will was prior (and \nnot beholden) to His reason. With Thomas Aquinas , God’s rationality \nhad been central; with Ockham, God’s will was central, causative of all \norder and rationality. Ockham also concluded that, correspondingly, \nany order that human beings found in their experience of the world \nwas constituted linguistically, and arbitrarily. This nominalism \namounted to a kind of radical individualism, in which any taxonomy \nthat arranged objects or entities (i.e. a forest comprised of trees) was \na contrivance of individual will rather than a connection that was \ninherent to the cosmos. God’s will was, above all, the determination of \nall order and rationality. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

All rights reserved. \n78 \nZombies in Western Culture\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that the emphasis on freedom and will \nthat emerged from the Black Plague  correlated with the explosion of \ncreativity in the Renaissance. However, there was also horror in this new \nvision. The decentering of reason from the Normative Order  meant that \nthe mind’s connection to the world had been greatly diminished. The \ndivine had become something non-rational and arbitrary, almost absurd, \nand the inherent meaning of Aristotle  and Aquinas’ worldviews had been \nreplaced by a gnawing sense that everything―including the self―was \nephemeral, strange, and something other than we thought it to be. This \nprimacy of the will undermined the notion of an ontological structure \nimbued with intrinsic value. It annulled the marriage  between the rational \nand the mystical that had been so essential to the Normative Order .\n6.2.2 Luther and the Narcissistic Self\nOver a century after the onset of the Black Death, theologian Martin \nLuther , backgrounded by the chaos of the times, was bringing together \ninfluences from Rhineland mysticism  and Ockham ’s theology. Luther \nwas an Augustinian monk, and like Augustine  himself, he had identified \nwith the tremendous internal conflict and self-loathing expressed in the \nwritings of St. Paul . Luther experienced the self-negation of Rhineland \nmysticism  more as a self-loathing, intrinsic to a degenerate self that \nwas both reflexively obsessed and dissatisfied. Luther wasn’t seeking \na mystical experience, but the same loss of self that the mystics sought \nto escape the narcissistic torment of their own self-preoccupation. Since \nthe self was vacuous and self-destructive, it could not be the vessel \nfor salvation. Any normative transformation had to be imposed from \nwithout by God’s will, which was raw, non-rational, and terrifyingly \narbitrary. Luther’s doctrine of grace and faith was the non-rational \nacceptance of this arbitrary will. \nAs Luther’s Protestant  Reformation grew, much of Europe came to \nbe dominated by these theological ideas, and they developed a deep \nfoothold in Western culture. Faith and salvation became personal rather \nthan collective undertakings, and individual conscience and choice \nbecame favored over institution and tradition. The mind’s most secure \nand meaningful  connection was no longer with the world, but with \nitself. Luther argued for a priesthood of all believers, a radical kind of \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 79\n6. An Introduction to the Genealogy of the Meaning Crisis\nequality in the church  without clerical authorities. In this way, Luther’s \nProtestantism help to prepare the way for political democracy. \nFor all his progressiveness, Luther’s views also contributed \nsignificantly to the development of the meaning crisis. In Luther’s \nProtestantism, the self most authentically experienced itself in the \nturmoil of self-loathing, and in the pursuit of God’s unearned grace, \nHis external validation. Without this validation, the spread of Luther’s \ntheology amounted to, among other things, a cultural training in \nnarcissism ; people were trained to seek external, unearned validation to \ncompensate for the notion of a vacuous, self-loathing self. Meanwhile, \nProtestantism began fracturing into an ever-growing number of sects. \nSuch expanding pluralism , combined with the radical individualism \nof Protestantism, meant that God increasingly became a purely private \nmatter of internal experience. Not only did “God” refer to something \narbitrary and absurd, it no longer referred to the same thing for different \npeople. The term was starting to become meaningless . \nLuther’s rejection of tradition and institution meant a transference of \nspiritual life from the institution to the home, and into one’s daily work. \nConsequently, the monasteries were shut down in Protestant  countries. \nUntil that time, the monastery and the university had been complementary \ninstitutions; the latter served the acquisition of knowledge, and the \nformer was the place wherein an individual cultivated wisdom, and \ntrained a spiritual process of self-transformation and self-transcendence. \nThese institutions and their associated functions were complementary \neducators. With the disappearance of the monasteries, this balance \nwas lost. Without a systemic way of cultivating wisdom, the growing \nnarcissism  trained by Luther’s theology―now focused in the everyday \npractices of home, work and family in which sacredness and spirituality \nwere now abstracted―was unchecked within the broader culture. \n6.2.3 Pluralism and the Copernican Revolution \nThe newly integrated senses of self-determination and individualism \ndescribed above helped to foster a rise in commercialism as Europe \nbegan to recover from the Black Plague . There was a prevailing belief \nthat an individual could alter one’s status through determined effort, \nand this belief seemed to engender increases in urbanization and trade. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n80 \nZombies in Western Culture\nBy extension, this gave rise to unprecedented social diversity and created \nthe need for efficient and impartial bureaucracies that could monitor \nand enforce the contracts so crucial to commercialism. The system of \ncontracts reinforced the idea that human beings could be connected to \neach other outside of shared kinships or religious affiliation. Societies \nslowly began to become more pluralistic, and this further undermined \nthe importance of a single order shared by all.\nThe engine of commercialism produced many unexpected \ninnovations from the Middle Ages  through to the Renaissance, and \nthese innovations set the scene for the transformations to come. The \ncomplexities of long distance trading and commerce put collective \npressure on the culture to develop better celestial navigation and \nmathematics to reduce the risk of losing ships at sea. This led to more \ncareful collection of data about the heavens and calculations about \nthe motions of heavenly bodies, revealing that the heavens were not \nbehaving as predicted by the Aristotelean-Ptolemaic model. Pragmatic \nimprovements to these mathematics inspired Copernicus ’ astronomical \nrevision that the sun, not the earth, was at the center of the known \nuniverse. \nThe revolution triggered by Copernicus ’ discovery upended the \npresumptions of Aristotle ’s epistemology. It demonstrated that a \nperson’s experience could pass each of Aristotle’s tests for reality―\nperception, medium and consensus―and still be wrong. The quality \nof experience was now subjective. Mathematics, not experience, was \nnow the measure of realness  and the language of the universe. If our \nfundamental cosmic orientation was misconceived, then everything was \nnow vulnerable to illusion. Suddenly the mind was no longer anchored \nto the structure of the cosmos, and Aristotle’s nomological order could \nno longer be trusted to keep us in conformity with the world.\nGalileo  took Copernicus ’ revolution even further with his discovery \nof inertial motion, which revealed that things did not move because of \nan internal purpose or cosmic drive, but because of accidental external \npushes from other, unintentional forces in the world. The loss of these \ndrives implied that here was no overarching metanarrative  at work \nwithin the cosmos, no story that enacted itself through the movements \nof objects and individuals. This meant that human beings were now \nstrangers, alone with our intent, acting with determined purpose in a \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central,\nCopyright © 2017. Open Book Publishers. All rights reserved. \n 81\n6. An Introduction to the Genealogy of the Meaning Crisis\nworld that fundamentally lacked it. The universe went from being a \nbeautiful, living cosmos unfolding a great story to a lifeless series of \nrandom collisions signifying nothing. \nThe dissonance between the human being’s experience of meaning \nand the purposeless vacuum introduced by Copernicus  and Galileo ’s \ndiscoveries inevitably interacted with Luther’s narcissistic self and \narbitrary God. In consequence, the mind’s connection to reality―and \nthe people and objects within it―was severed and the mind was trapped \ninside the illusion of its own experience. With the discovery of inertial \nmotion, it became clear that matter was not the potential for form, but \nsubstance in its own right. Form was not, after all, the blueprint for cosmic \npurpose, but simply the result of how motion shaped matter. There \nwas no value-based hierarchy governing reality any more than there \nwas a great narrative to guide it. So there was no longer a nomological \norder  uniting the mind to the world, no overarching narrative order  \nproviding the purpose for it all, and no normative order  for ascending \nto the divine. \nThe historical domicide  described within the loss of these three \norders represe nts a  comprehensive breakdown of the agent-arena  \ncorrespondence discussed in section 3.4.3 , which is essential to creating \nand sustaining a worldview . Therefore, the symbo l of the zombie \napocalypse , elucidated by our four horsemen of the apocalypse ( section \n5), exemplifies the loss of these orders in its portrayal of the “Gray Life” \nof the meaning crisis. \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

As this traditional framework has eroded without a viable replacement, society is left in a state of spiritual bankruptcy, with the versatile zombie myth reflecting the resulting despair, faithlessness, and encroaching nihilism.",
      "long_summary": "This is a detailed summary of Chapter 7, \"Conclusion,\" from the book *Zombies in Western Culture*.\n\n### Core Argument: The Zombie as a Symbol for a Crisis of Meaning\n\nThe chapter concludes that the modern zombie mythos is a powerful and versatile symbol—a \"mythogram\"—for a profound and multifaceted \"crisis in meaning\" in contemporary Western culture. The authors argue that this crisis, like the ecological crisis, is an emergent problem with no single cause or simple solution. It stems from the complex interplay of historical forces and cannot be fixed with a \"silver technological bullet.\"\n\n### The Decline of Christianity as the Central Ailment\n\nAt the heart of this crisis is the gradual but steady decline of the Christian worldview. For two millennia, Christianity provided a comprehensive \"worldview attunement\" that integrated the personal, social, political, and spiritual aspects of life. The authors argue that as this framework has lost its hold, a void has been created.\n\nThis has led to a central paradox:\n*   **Increasing Secularity:** Society is demonstrably moving away from religious institutions.\n*   **Persistent Religious Need:** Popular culture, particularly superhero myths, constantly refers back to Christian forms and themes. This suggests a deep, unconscious need for the kind of meaning that a religious worldview provides.\n\nThis tension is embodied by the \"religious 'nones,'\" who find themselves caught between secular and religious identities, wanting a perspective that can integrate both.\n\n### The Trilemma: A Dead End with No Viable Alternatives\n\nThe authors present the current predicament as a \"trilemma\"—three unworkable options for solving the crisis of meaning:\n\n1.  **Retrieving Christianity:** This is an \"ill-fated\" solution because the very decline of Christianity is a core part of the problem. Simply trying to go back will not work.\n2.  **Secular Ideologies:** Twentieth-century attempts to replace religion with secular, political meta-narratives (e.g., fascism, communism) resulted in trauma and disaster. Society is now rightly wary of repeating this.\n3.  **Nihilism:** With the religious framework fading and secular replacements proving counterfeit and dangerous, the only remaining path appears to be the \"raw domicide of nihilism\"—a complete destruction of meaning and spiritual bankruptcy.\n\nThe authors note that the very \"cure\" that saved the Hellenistic world from a similar crisis—the philosophical framework that became the foundation of Christianity—is now the source of the ailment, leaving society at an impasse.\n\n### The Zombie Apocalypse as the Perfect Metaphor\n\nThe zombie and its apocalyptic narrative serve as a powerful, multi-layered symbol for this entire crisis.\n\n*   **Symbol of Decay and Meaninglessness:** The zombie represents a \"vapid environment, the craving monster, the perverted transformation of world,\" and a lack of any clear explanation or solution.\n*   **Perversion of Christian Tropes:** The myth centers on a dark inversion of Christian concepts like apocalypse and resurrection, directly reflecting the \"eclipse of the religious worldview.\"\n*   **A Polymorphic Monster:** The zombie's ambiguity allows it to be an \"exegetically polymorphic monster\"—a versatile symbol for despair, decay, faithlessness, the estrangement of individuals, and the loss of agency.\n*   **No Easy Solution:** The fact that there is no \"stake or silver bullet\" for a zombie apocalypse mirrors the complexity of the meaning crisis, which cannot be solved by simple technological or intellectual fixes.\n\n### Conclusion and Future Outlook\n\nThe authors stress that their purpose is not to resign themselves to nihilism but to articulate the deep correlation between the zombie zeitgeist and the cultural void left by the decline of Christianity. They use the term \"domicide\" (the destruction of home or a sense of belonging) to describe the disintegration of meaning across personal, social, political, and spiritual systems.\n\nThey conclude with a warning: in the absence of a \"new sacred canopy\" or a viable meta-meaning system, this \"gradual onslaught of meaninglessness\" will likely continue to threaten and infect Western culture for the foreseeable future. The chapter ends by noting that the question of how to salvage a meaningful framework in a secular world is the most significant problem society faces and will be the subject of the authors' future work.",

Conclusion\nFig. 13: Prevalence of words from 1930-2010 in predominantly English \nbooks published in any country.1\nOur four horsemen of the apocalypse  are, like the zombie itself, \nmythograms for a crisis in meaning that is decentered from any particular \nobject or symptom that may refer back to it. Just like our present \necological crisis, there is no single anthropogenic or historical cause; \nrather, it is emergent from the unpredictable combinations of historical \nand perennial forces that define the interactional tension between agent \nand arena.

Responding to such \nan emergent problem is not simply a matter of doctoring. Communities \nof intelligent people can combine knowledge to triage problems in \nmedicine, economics, and engineering, but resolving the problems \ndiscussed in the second half of this book requires more than simply \npooling knowledge and resources; the solution, like the problem, must \nbe more complex than the sum of these parts.\nThe problem seems sufficiently nebulous that we cannot ruminate \nour way out of it, and while it is not our intention to foreclose the \npossibilities that human ingenuity might bring to bear, the problem is \nlikely too multifarious to be treated with any existing cultural apparatus. \nAs we have argued, the only apparatus that provided a comprehensive \nworldview  attunement ―which could both empower and connect the \narenas of individual, social, spiritual and political life in the way that we \ncrave―is no longer a live option for us. \nIt is not controversial to note that the features of our Christian  \nworldview  are the prime movers behind many of our cultural zeitgeists. \nIf this is true, it is also likely that the rising popularity of the superhero  \nmyths and similar trends reflect an unconscious response to the loss \nof that worldview. These mythologies, as we have discussed, contain \nunmistakable recursions to Christian forms, and that these mythologies \nare so culturally powerful may suggest that our need for a religious \nworldview retains a powerful hold over us. Despite our increasing \nskepticism and secularity, we are continually referring back to our \nmost known spiritual quantity. This paradox reveals a complicated \ntension: our research demonstrates that we are increasingly―and \nperhaps irreversibly―abdicating religious institutions, but our cultural \nmythologies depict us ever more desperately beholden to religious \nmeanings. This tension is embodied in the religious “nones”  who hang \nambiguously between secular and religious identities, wanting for \nsomething that integrates and transcends the realness  of both of these \nperspectives. \nA worldview  that governed perspective for two millennia does not \nsimply vanish. Its decline is gradual like that of many lesser empires. \nIts continued influence through the kaleidoscope of popular culture \nis a trailing therapy to disarm the nihilism  of a secularizing world. \nYet it is doomed to fail in this role.

All rights reserved. \n 85\n7. Conclusion\nChristianity  contain little that is new or revelatory, and their gesturing \nhas an inert effect rather than a transcendent one. If this crisis has in \npart been induced by the decline of Christianity, then attempting \nto retrieve Christianity is an ill-fated attempt at a solution. The very \nhard problem is this: that we suffer a lack of viable alternatives. As we \nhave discussed, twentieth century solutions to the problem of religious \ndecline have resulted in the trauma of disastrous political ideologies. We \nare rightly wary of duplicating this result with another secular attempt \nat worldview attunement . Absent these meta-meaning  systems―one \ndiminishing, and the other counterfeit―the only alternative seems to be \nthe raw domicide  of nihilism. \nThe impasse posed by this trilemma is a spiritual bankruptcy that \ncannot be thwarted by the benefit of historical hindsight; our only known \ncure for cultural domicide ―the one that relieved the Hellenes ―is now \nat the very centre of the ailment. The philosopher-as-physician was the \nfountainhead of Christianity ’s spiritual framework, and our divestment \nfrom this framework foregrounds our current predicament. It remains \nunclear to what extent, and in what form, this framework can be \nsalvaged in a secular world, and this is the most significant formulation \nof the problem we face as a society. This unanswered question, while \noutside the scope of this discussion, will be the subject of the authors’ \nforthcoming work. \nOur spiritual bankruptcy, deepened and exacerbated by the \nsymptoms of crisis in each of our horseman’s domains, are symbolized \npowerfully by the zombie apocalypse : by the vapid environment, the \ncraving monster, the perverted transformation of world, the lack of \ninstructive precedent, and the absence of an apparatus to treat or to \nexplain. The growing recognition that there is no single technological \nsolution to the environmental crisis corresponds to the lack of stake \nor silver bullet for a zombie apocalypse. The semiosis of the zombie’s \nphysicality, the ambiguity around its name and iconicity, its subversion \nof archetypally heroic narratives and its undermining of our purchase on \nrealness : all of this serves to make the zombie an exegetically polymorphic \nmonster―a versatile symbol  for despair, decay and faithlessness. That \nthe zombie’s myth centers on the abjection of Christian  apocalypse and \nresurrection  suggests that its evolution is culturally responsive to the \neclipse of the religious worldview , reflecting a loss of normative agency \nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

To say that a problem is not easily \nsolved is not to say that it is unsolvable. Rather, the purpose of this work \nhas been to articulate the ways in which the symbol  of this prominent \ncultural zeitgeist correlate to the decline of the Christian  worldview , and \nto the many forms of crises that seem in turn connected to this decline. \nIt remains imperative not to permit the voguishness of the zombie \nzeitgeist to undermine its philosophical import when appreciating the \nimpact of a crisis in meaning, nor to reductively attribute the zeitgeist \nto any single horseman of crisis discussed in this book. The effects of \nboth the Grassy Narrows  and Hellenistic  domicides discussed in section \n4 adduce the gravity of consequence that follows the disintegration of \na meta-meaning  system. A comparable disintegration is extant; the \nzombie is a multi-vocal analogue for the contemporaneous domicides \noccurring in the personal, social, political and spiritual systems of the \npresent. We may speculate without great imagination that this gradual \nonslaught of meaninglessness will―in the absence of a new sacred \ncanopy―continue to threaten and infect us for the foreseeable future.2\n2        This book is situated within a more encompassing argument, presented in Buddhism \nand Cognitive Science : Responding to the Meaning Crisis , University of Toronto. \nAvailable on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc8wy_4H8X8\nZombies in Western Culture : A Twenty-First Century Crisis, Open Book Publishers, 2017.

The cited works cover diverse topics including suicide, social isolation, economic crises, and the search for meaning, suggesting an interdisciplinary analysis of the zombie phenomenon as a symptom of modern societal anxieties.",
      "long_summary": "Of course. Here is a detailed summary and analysis of the provided chapter.\n\n### **Summary of the \"Chapter\"**\n\nThe provided text is not a narrative chapter but rather the **\"References\" section**, also known as a bibliography, for the book **_Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis_**. This section lists all the academic papers, books, reports, and other sources that the author(s) cited throughout their work to support their arguments.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a plot or a direct argument to summarize, this list is incredibly revealing. By analyzing the types of sources cited, we can deduce the central themes, arguments, and overall intellectual framework of the book itself. The references act as a blueprint for the book's main ideas.\n\n### **Analysis of Themes and Inferred Arguments**\n\nThe collection of references suggests that _Zombies in Western Culture_ is a serious academic work that uses the zombie metaphor to diagnose a profound, multi-faceted crisis in modern Western society. The book likely argues that the popularity of the zombie genre is not mere entertainment, but a reflection of real-world anxieties related to social, economic, and existential collapse.\n\nThe sources can be grouped into several key thematic areas:\n\n**1. The Crisis of Social Disconnection and Loneliness:**\n*   A significant number of sources deal with social isolation. Works by **Cacioppo et al.** (\"Alone in the Crowd\"), **McPherson et al.** (\"Social Isolation in America\"), and **Holt-Lunstad et al.** (\"Loneliness and Social Isolation as Risk Factors for Mortality\") point to a core argument that modern individuals are becoming increasingly disconnected from one another.\n*   The book likely connects the mindless, shuffling zombie horde to the experience of individuals feeling anonymous and isolated within a crowd. It also likely contrasts this with the small, tight-knit survivor groups in zombie fiction, which represent a desperate longing for genuine community.\n\n**2. The Epidemic of Suicide and Despair:**\n*   This is arguably the most prominent theme in the bibliography. There are numerous references to academic studies on suicide from sociological, psychological, and public health perspectives.\n*   Sources like **Durkheim's** foundational work, _Le Suicide_, are central, suggesting the book frames suicide not just as an individual psychological issue, but as a social phenomenon tied to a lack of social integration and regulation.\n*   Other studies link rising suicide rates directly to specific modern pressures:\n    *   **Economic Crises:** **Chang et al.** (2008 global crisis), **Hempstead & Phillips** (job and financial circumstances), and **Reeves et al.** (recession) are cited to show a direct link between economic instability and suicide.\n    *   **Demographics:** **Curtin et al.** and **Sullivan et al.** provide data on the increase in suicide in the United States, particularly among middle-aged adults.\n*   The \"zombie\" state can therefore be interpreted as a metaphor for a life devoid of purpose and hope—a kind of living death that precedes or is an alternative to actual suicide.\n\n**3. The Search for Meaning in a Secular Age:**\n*   The author draws heavily on philosophy and theology to explore the loss of traditional meaning-making structures.\n*   Works like **Viktor Frankl's** _Man's Search for Meaning_, **Dreyfus and Kelly's** _All Things Shining_ (about finding meaning in a secular age), and **Charles Taylor's** _The Malaise of Modernity_ indicate the book tackles the existential vacuum left by declining religious belief and traditional values.\n*   The inclusion of **Dervic et al.** and **Hilton et al.** on the protective effects of religious affiliation against suicide reinforces this argument, suggesting that the loss of religious community contributes to the crisis.\n\n**4. Cultural and Media Analysis of the Zombie Trope:**\n*   The book grounds its analysis in the genre itself. References to **Moreman** (\"Dharma of the Living Dead\"), **Webb and Byrnand** (\"The Zombie as Body and as Trope\"), and **Ostwalt** (on apocalyptic themes in film) show that the author is engaging with existing scholarship on zombie and apocalyptic media.\n*   This suggests the book is not just using the zombie as a random metaphor but is performing a detailed cultural critique of how the trope has evolved and what it signifies today.\n\n**5. The Socio-Political Context:**\n*   The inclusion of sources on voter turnout (**Pintor et al.**, **Solijonov**) and \"post-truth\" phenomena (**Frankfurt's** _On Bullshit_, **Keyes'** _The Post-Truth Era_) suggests the crisis extends to a breakdown in civic engagement and shared reality. The zombie, who acts without thought or reason, can be seen as a metaphor for a disengaged or easily manipulated populace.\n\n### **Conclusion (Inferred Thesis of the Book)**\n\nBased on this bibliography, the book _Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis_ likely argues that the zombie apocalypse narrative has become a dominant cultural metaphor for a very real and measurable crisis in the West. This crisis is defined by:\n\n*   **Social Atomization:** The breakdown of communities and the rise of chronic loneliness.\n*   **Existential Despair:** A loss of meaning, purpose, and hope in a secular, economically precarious world, manifesting in rising suicide rates.\n*   **Economic Anxiety:** The constant pressure of financial instability and meaningless labor.\n\nThe zombie represents the individual who has succumbed to this crisis—a mindless consumer, an isolated soul, or a person hollowed out by despair. The fantasy of the zombie apocalypse, in turn, reflects a deep-seated desire to wipe the slate clean and rebuild a world based on meaningful human connection and survival.",

      "short_summary": "Based on the provided index, this book analyzes the modern zombie phenomenon as a symbol for a crisis of meaning and \"worldview\" in Western culture, focusing on themes like apocalypse and the loss of home (domicide). The author contrasts the collapse of traditional meaning-making structures like Christianity with other frameworks, such as the Anishinaabe worldview, to explore the contemporary search for purpose and reality.",
      "long_summary": "Of course. Here is a detailed summary based on the provided text.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Summary and Analysis of \"Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis\" (Inferred from the Index)**\n\nIt is important to note that the provided text is not a chapter but the **index** of the book *Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis*. An index lists key terms and the pages on which they appear. Therefore, this summary is a detailed inference of the book's central arguments and structure, synthesized from the concepts the author frequently references and connects.\n\n#### **Core Thesis: The Zombie Apocalypse as a Symbol of a Crisis of Meaning**\n\nThe book argues that the modern fascination with zombies and the apocalypse is not a mere pop-culture trend but a powerful **symbol** of a profound and ongoing crisis in Western culture. This crisis is fundamentally one of **meaning**, specifically the collapse of the traditional Christian worldview that once provided a stable sense of order, purpose, and \"home.\" The zombie—a mindless, purposeless, and destructive being—represents the state of humanity in a world stripped of this \"sacred canopy.\"\n\n#### **Key Concepts and Arguments**\n\n**1. Domicide: The Destruction of Home and Worldview**\nThe most central and recurring original concept is **domicide** (literally, \"home-killing\"). This term appears on numerous pages and is linked to both historical and fictional events. Domicide is not just about physical homelessness; it signifies the destruction of one's entire **worldview**—the intellectual, spiritual, and cultural framework that makes the world feel like a coherent, meaningful home. The zombie apocalypse is the ultimate narrative of domicide, where survivors are violently uprooted and the world they knew is annihilated.\n\n**2. A Genealogy of Meaninglessness**\nThe author traces a **genealogy** of this crisis, arguing that its roots lie deep in Western history. The narrative starts with the cohesive worldview of the Middle Ages, built on a synthesis of **Aristotle** and Christianity (e.g., **Thomas Aquinas**). This system provided a three-tiered **narrative, nomological, and normative order** that explained the universe, humanity's place in it, and how one should live.\n\nThis stable worldview began to unravel with figures like **William of Ockham** and was further fractured by the Reformation (**Martin Luther**) and the Scientific Revolution (**Copernicus, Galileo**), which dismantled the old cosmic and religious order. This historical arc leads to a modern condition described as living \"**After God**,\" where traditional religious structures have lost their authority.\n\n**3. The Real-World Case Study: Grassy Narrows**\nTo ground the abstract concept of domicide in reality, the book uses the tragic experience of the **Anishinaabe** people of **Grassy Narrows** as a central, recurring case study. The index shows this community is discussed in relation to domicide, worldview, and high rates of **suicide**. The author likely presents their story—the destruction of their traditional lands, culture, and way of life by external forces—as a real-world microcosm of the zombie apocalypse. It is a concrete example of a people who have suffered domicide and now face a crisis of meaning and survival, just like the characters in *The Walking Dead*.\n\n**4. The Symptoms of the Modern Crisis**\nIn the wake of this collapsed worldview, modern society exhibits several symptoms, which the zombie narrative reflects:\n*   **The Rise of the \"Nones\":** The growing number of people with no religious affiliation (\"nones\") is a key indicator of the collapse of the traditional Christian meta-narrative. This group is adrift without a guiding framework.\n*   **Suicide and Despair:** The book links the loss of meaning directly to a rise in social pathologies like **suicide**, drawing on the work of thinkers like **Émile Durkheim** and **Victor Frankl** (*Man's Search for Meaning*).\n*   **Cynicism and \"Bullshit\":** In a world without a shared sense of truth or purpose, society degrades into **cynicism** and what philosopher **Harry Frankfurt** calls \"**bullshit**\" (a disregard for truth). The author connects this to contemporary politics (Trump, Sanders) and media (The Daily Show), suggesting these are manifestations of the same cultural malaise.\n*   **The Search for New \"Meta-Meaning\":** Humanity cannot live in a vacuum of meaning. The book explores how people attempt to construct new, often secular, systems of \"meta-meaning.\" These are referred to as **pseudo-religions** and include everything from fandoms (**Star Wars' Jedi, Bronies**) and ideologies (**Americanism, Marxism**) to the worship of **superheroes**. However, the book likely argues these new systems are often fragile and insufficient replacements for the comprehensive \"sacred canopy\" that was lost.\n\n#### **The Zombie Narrative as a Mirror**\n\nThe index is filled with references to classic and modern zombie media (*Night of the Living Dead*, *Dawn of the Dead*, *The Walking Dead*, *World War Z*). The author uses these texts to illustrate the key themes:\n*   **The Apocalypse:** The apocalypse in these stories is a complete rupture of the old order, forcing survivors to confront a meaningless, hostile world. It is the ultimate expression of domicide.\n*   **The Four Horsemen:** The traditional apocalyptic symbols of the **four horsemen** (War, Famine, Pestilence) are re-contextualized for a secular age, representing the total breakdown of society.\n*   **Loss of \"Realness\":** The crisis is ultimately a search for **\"realness\"**—for something solid and true in a world that feels fake or meaningless. The zombie narrative strips away all modern artifice, forcing characters to confront primal truths about survival and humanity.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nIn essence, *Zombies in Western Culture* posits that the zombie is the monster for our age because it perfectly embodies our deepest cultural anxieties. It is a symbol of our collective experience of **domicide**—the loss of a stable, meaningful world. By analyzing the \"genealogy\" of this crisis from the Hellenistic Era to the present and grounding it in the real-world trauma of communities like Grassy Narrows, the book argues that the zombie apocalypse is more than entertainment; it is a desperate cultural expression of our struggle with **meaninglessness**, **nihilism**, and the search for a new worldview to call home.",
